It is great to be here in the city of Henderson, in the beautiful state of Nevada - a state where I have so many great friends and employees.\nIn 34 days, we are going to win this state, we are going to win the White House.\n\nHow many of you watched the Vice Presidential Debate last night?\n\nMike did such an incredible job. I would argue that Mike had the single most decisive victory in the history of Vice Presidential debates.\n\nLast night America also got a firsthand look at my judgement and the judgement of my opponent. Our first Presidential decision was the selection of our running mates, and all of America saw that I made the right choice.\n\nWhile Mike laid out big and bold solutions for America, his opponent talked only of small and petty distractions.\n\nHillary Clinton has been there for 30 years, and hasn't fixed anything. In fact, she's just made things worse - she failed upstate New York, promising to create 200,000 jobs, but manufacturing is down almost 40 percent. She failed overseas, producing only death and destruction - she unleashed ISIS, destabilized Iraq, Syria and Libya, and put Iran on the path to nuclear weapons.\n\nAt home, Hillary Clinton failed Latinos and African-Americans, producing only more poverty in the inner cities.\n\nShe is merely the vessel for the global special interests bleeding this country dry.\n\nI am running to represent Americans - and we are going to make America Rich again.\n\nI am going to end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, keep jobs from pouring out of our country, renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, and massively reduce taxes and regulations on our workers and our small businesses.\n\nMy economic agenda is very simple: jobs, jobs, jobs.\n\nThe problems we face as a country are immense, and it is going to take bold action to turn things around.\n\nRight now, we owe $20 trillion in debt. It doubled under President Obama.\n\nOur infrastructure is like that of a third-world country.\n\nThe homicide rate last year experienced the biggest single-year increase in 45 years.\n\nOur police are under-funded, under-staffed, and under-supported - and Hillary Clinton basically accuses our police of all being racist.\n\nOur border is wide open, and drugs and criminal cartels are pouring into the country.\n\nThousands of refugees are being admitted, with no way to screen them, and are instantly made eligible for welfare and free healthcare - even as our own Veterans die waiting for the medical care they need.\n\nOur annual trade deficit with the world is nearly $800 billion a year.\n\nThe federal budget is a disaster. Our State Department, mostly under the watch of Hillary Clinton, misplaced or lost $6 billion in taxpayer funds.\n\nWe have the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.\n\nWe are a nation divided, with race riots in the streets.\n\nOur college students graduate, loaded with debt, only to discover they can't find jobs - or certainly not the jobs they want.\n\nOur allies aren't paying their fair share, foreign countries like Russia and China do not respect us, and our taxpaying citizens send troops and foreign aid all over the world even as their own cities can't provide the most basic services.\n\nAmerica needs a turnaround.\n\nAmerica needs a comeback.\n\nAmerica needs a change.\n\nThat is why I am running.\n\nOn November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is back - bigger, and better, and stronger than ever before.\n\nFirst, we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare.\n\nPresident Obama said if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor.\n\nThat was a lie.\n\nHe promised his plan would reduce premiums by $2,500 dollars. Instead, they surged $5,000.\n\nAnother lie.\n\nNow, of all people, President Bill Clinton has come out and told the truth about Obamacare.\n\nTwo days ago, Bill Clinton torched President Obama's signature legislation. Remember, Hillary Clinton called Obamacare \"one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, of the Democratic Party, and of our country.\"\n\nBill has a different view. Here is what bill said:\n\nHe just said it's a \"crazy system,\" and that \"it's the craziest thing in the world.\"\n\nBill said:\n\n\"people out there  busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week,  wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half-\u00c2\u0089the people getting killed in this deal are the small business people and the individuals who make just a bit too much money to get any of these subsidies.\" Clinton added that it \"doesn't make any sense,\" and that \"the insurance model doesn't work.\"\n\nOn my first day in office, I am going to ask a Republican Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace Obamacare.\n\nThere is only one way to stop Obamacare: to vote for Trump. The deadline to register to vote by mail is October 8th. The deadline to register to vote online or in-person is October 18th. And early voting begins on the 22nd.\n\nFixing our trade deals will be the foundation of our economic revival\n\nChina, Japan, and Europe are printing huge sums of money - the devaluation of currencies is staggering as to what it represents for our country, our businesses, and our citizens.\n\nWe're not on a level playing field, and our politicians don't understand what is going on.\n\nOur jobs are being lost in massive numbers, and we are not making things in America anymore. Too much is being made in other countries.\n\nWhen I am President, we will start making things in America again.\n\nOur nation has lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton's NAFTA - a deal supported by Hillary Clinton. Hillary's Korea deal also cost us another 100,000 jobs.\n\nSince China entered the World Trade Organization - another Bill and Hillary-backed deal - 70,000 factories have shut down or left the United States.\n\nThat's 15 factories closing a day, on average.\n\nWe are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.\n\nAs the factories leave, our money leaves with them. Stores close, schools suffer, the tax base erodes, wages fall and the quality of life declines.\n\nReal cash wages for many workers today are lower than they were in 1973.\n\nWe've rebuilt other countries at the expense of our own. Skyscrapers go up in Beijing, while plants and factories crumble in the United States.\n\nCompanies like Carrier, General Electric, Motorola, Mattel, Fiat Chrysler, and so many others are moving their jobs to Mexico, and to other countries.\n\nAnd now, Ford has announced it's moving all of its small car production to Mexico also.\n\nWe are going to renegotiate NAFTA and if we don't get the deal we want, we will withdraw from NAFTA and start over to get a much better deal for our workers.\n\nWe are also going to stand up to foreign currency manipulation, and apply tariffs to countries that cheat.\n\nWe will also stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the deal Hillary called the \"Gold Standard.\" The backers of the deal have donated heavily to Hillary Clinton, and their wish is her command.\n\nShe is an insider fighting only for herself and for her donors.\n\nI am an outsider fighting for YOU.\n\nWe will stop the foreign cheating, the product dumping, and the one-sided trade deals. We will lower taxes on American business, from 35% to 15%, and many small businesses will file as individuals any pay only 12 percent. On top of that, we will have the largest regulatory reform in American history.\n\nOur tax, trade, energy and regulatory reforms will help us reach 4% growth and create at least 25 million new jobs in a decade.\n\nAmerica will become the great jobs magnet of the world.\n\nFactories will come rushing in, our schools and communities will be revitalized, and our poorest citizens will get new jobs and higher pay -and new hope.\n\nBut to be a rich nation, we must also be a secure nation.\n\nSecurity begins at the border.\n\nAny government that does not protect its own people is a government unworthy and unfit to lead.\n\nCountless Americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this President Obama and Hillary Clinton.\n\nThis includes incredible Americans like 21-year-old Sarah Root. The man who killed her arrived at the border, entered federal custody, and then was released into a U.S. community under the immigration policies of Obama-Clinton. He was released again after the crime, and is now at large.\n\nSarah had graduated from college with a 4.0, top of her class, the day before.\n\nAlso among the victims of the Obama-Clinton open borders policies was Grant Ronnebeck, a 21 year-old convenience store clerk in Mesa, Arizona. He was murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted of burglary who had also been released from Federal Custody.\n\nAnother victim is Kate Steinle, gunned down in the Sanctuary City of San Francisco by an illegal immigrant deported five previous times.\n\nThen there is the case of 90 year-old Earl Olander, who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death in his home. The perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records who did not meet the Obama Administration's priorities for removal.\n\nIn California, a 64-years old Air Force Veteran, Marilyn Pharis, was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer. Her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions, but was never deported.\n\nAlso in California, my good friend, Jamiel Shaw, lost his amazing son at the age of 17 - he was viciously shot and killed by an illegal immigrant. The killer had 3 gun charges, as well as battery of a police officer, prior to the shooting but he had not been deported from our country.\n\nThere are more than 2 million criminal aliens with criminal convictions in the country right now, and more who have escaped the law entirely - when I am President, we are getting them out, and we are getting them out quickly.\n\nAll Americans living lawfully in this country, including millions of patriotic hardworking immigrants, are entitled to have their jobs, their wages, and their security protected. The borders around our nation are for the benefit of all people living here today - and when those borders are erased, it's often the lawful immigrants already here who are the first to suffer lost jobs and decreased security.\n\nAt the same time, our country is being infiltrated by terrorists. Just two days ago, an immigrant from Bangladesh was charged in another ISIS plot. Hundreds of immigrants from high-risk regions have been implicated in terrorism inside the United States since 9\/11.\n\nThe terrorists who planted the bombs in New York and Jersey, and who carried out the mall stabbing in Minnesota, were foreign nationals admitted into our country - as was the mall shooter in Washington State. Now, the media doesn't want to talk about this - they don't want to ask how our vetting procedures failed, or how immigration from high-risk parts of the world increased the chances of terrorism and violence.\n\nThe Boston Bombers were here on asylum. The San Bernardino Shooter was here on a fiance visa from Saudi Arabia. The Orlando shooter was the son of a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan.\n\nI am going to keep the terrorists out of our country.\n\nHillary Clinton wants a 550% increase in Syrian Refugees.\n\nHillary is for open borders.\n\nI am not running to be President of the world. I am running to be President of the United States. I am for America First.\n\nFor the first time in American history, we have the endorsement of our ICE officers and our Border Patrol officers.\n\nWe are going to build a border wall, enforce our laws, and keep our people safe. I have a simple message for the cartels, the gang members, and the drug dealers preying on our citizens - your days are numbered, and your reign of crime will soon come crashing to an end.\n\nWe are also going to end the government corruption\n\nHillary Clinton put her emails on an illegal secret server open to foreign hacking. Then she bleached and destroyed 33,000 emails - after a congressional subpoena. She lied to Congress, under oath, and her staffers took the Fifth Amendment and got immunity deals.\n\nNow we have learned that the FBI made a side deal with Clinton's top aides to DESTROY their laptops.\n\nHillary Clinton is the ringleader of a criminal enterprise and the only way to deliver justice is to mail in your ballots.\n\nWe are also going to fix our inner cities, and help Latino Americans\n\n45% of African-American children under the age of 6 live in poverty.\n\n58% of African-American youth don't have jobs.\n\nMore than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.\n\nHomicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.\n\nThe Democrats, like Hillary Clinton, have run the inner cities for 50 years, sixty years, seventy years or more. They've produced only more joblessness, failing schools, and rising crime.\n\nTo those African-Americans suffering in our country I say: What do you have to lose? Vote For Donald Trump. I will fix it.\n\nI am also going to fight to help millions of Latinos trapped in poverty, and to help their children grow up in safety and peace.\n\nPoor communities will see a massive infusion of new small businesses, and new high-paying jobs. I am also going to fight to provide school choice to every low-income African-American and Latino child in this nation.\n\nI want to put every American child on the ladder of success: a great education, and a high-paying job.\n\nHere are some more amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:\n\nWe are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; end common core; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; make childcare affordable; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\n\nThis Election Day, you have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this country.\n\nOn November 8th, the arrogance of Washington D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.\n\nThe failed and corrupt political establishment will be replaced with a new government of, by and for the people.\n\nI am going to fight for every last citizen in this land, and I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.\n\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\n\nYou're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this day. This is a movement like you've never seen before. We're going to make history together.\n\nYou're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote I've ever cast for anyone at any time.\n\nA vote for me is a vote for change, and a vote for me is really a vote for you. You are voting to believe in yourselves. You are voting to believe in your country.\n\nAll together, we are going to -\n\nMake America wealthy again.\n\nWe are going to make America strong again.\n\nWe are going to make America safe again.\n\nAnd we are going to make America great again.\u0000","1":"Thank you. \nThank you very much. \n\nWe love New Hampshire, I can tell you that. \n\nI need to open with a very critical breaking news announcement. \n\nThe FBI has just sent a letter to Congress informing them that they have discovered new e-mails pertaining to the former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's investigation\n\nAnd they are reopening her case into her criminal and illegal conduct that threatens the security of the United States of America. \n\nHillary Clinton's corruption is on a scale we have never seen before. We must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office. I have great respect for the fact that the FBI and the Department of Justice are now willing to have the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made. \n\nThis was a grave miscarriage of justice that the American people fully understood. And it is everybody's hope that it is about to be corrected. \n\nSo that is a big announcement that I heard 10 minutes ago and I guess obviously most of you folks have heard about, and in all fairness for all of the people that have suffered for doing so much less, including just recently four-star General James Cartwright, General Petraeus and many others. Perhaps finally justice will be done. \n\nWith that being said, the rest of my speech is going to be so boring. Should I even make the speech? We will talk about borders, right? We will talk about trade. We'll bring back our jobs, we'll strengthen our military and let's get going, OK? \n\nI want to thank General Flynn, he's a great general and I want to thank you for being here, General. Thank you very much. Just before General Flynn was going up we heard this news. I said, \"General get up there and keep them busy. We want to digest what just happened here.\" Thank you General.\n\nIn 11 days we are going to win New Hampshire  the state of my first victory. And we are going to win back the White House. \n\nSeventy-five percent of the American people think our country is on the wrong track and we are going to fix it. We are going to get our country back on the right track, and very, very quickly. Real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing Obamacare \n\nWe can't forget how big a news that is, we can't lose track. It's a disaster, just like everything else in this administration.\n\nIt has just been announced that Americans are going to experience another massive double-digit hike in Obamacare premiums, including a 116 percent premium hike to our very good friends in the great state of Arizona.\n\nEven Bill Clinton admitted Obamacare is the craziest thing in the world, where people wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half.\n\nIn Minnesota, where the premium increase will be almost 60 percent, the Democratic governor said the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable. Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare  admitted it was all a fraud and he said it was passed because of the stupidity of the American voter. Hey, we're doing a lot of good work, aren't we? We're catching all of these people. We're doing a good job. Jonathan Gruber, there's another. See, we didn't forget. I never forgot Jonathan Gruber.\n\nI said you know, if I do this, we're going to run and his name came up and people forget after a week or two. I said I am never going to forget Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare and what he said. So we did not forget. Almost can you imagine, it's like a little more than a week before the election. We didn't forget the name Jonathan Gruber.\n\nBut the only real stupidity is that shown by our politicians who passed this monstrosity over the furious objection of certain politicians and the American voter. Job-killing Obamacare is just one more way the system is rigged. What I've just announced previously it might not be as rigged as I thought. Right? Right? \n\nThe FBI I think they're going to right the ship, folks. I think they're going to right the ship. \n\nAnd they're going to save their reputation by doing so.\n\nHillary Clinton wants to double down on Obamacare, destroying American health care forever. She wants to expand Obamacare and make it even more expensive. I will repeal and replace Obamacare and we will replace it with a much less expensive plan and a plan that is much, much better. \n\nJust this year, Hillary Clinton declared Obamacare is one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, the Democratic Party and our country. Well, that was that's turned out to be wrong. Do they do anything right? We don't win anymore. We don't I mean, you're going to have such a good time starting in '17. We're going to start winning again. We're going to start winning again. \n\nBecause it's turned out, and I've been saying this from before it passed, Obamacare is a catastrophe beyond imagination. Insurers are leaving, doctors are quitting, companies are fleeing, workers' hours are being cut, part-time jobs are all over the place. Those beautiful full-time jobs that you used to have don't exist and deductibles are through the roof. You don't get to use it. We don't get rid of Obamacare, we have no choice. But if we don't get rid of it, our health care system is gone forever. We'll never have another chance.\n\nAnd by the way, if we don't win this election, you're never going to have another chance either, that I can tell you. Never going to happen again. Repealing Obamacare is one of the single most important reasons we must win on November 8th. \n\nBut real change also means getting rid of the corruption in Washington, and again, maybe that's happened. Wow. We have a big day. \n\nNo think of it, I won my first primary in New Hampshire and I am getting here and the news this morning is this is bigger than Watergate. This is bigger than Watergate in my opinion. This is bigger than Watergate \n\nHillary bleached and deleted 33,000 e-mails after receiving a congressional subpoena. That alone to me there were more serious things done, but how does it get much more? But that was so obvious. She gets the subpoena and she bleaches and deletes 33,000 e-mails. That to me because it was so simple, you know? Not it's not about the sale of the uranium that nobody knows what it means I know what it means to Russia. Then she talks to me about Russia. 20 percent of the uranium in our country to Russia.\n\nBut you know, the deletion of 33,000 e-mails, boy, that just sort of is so out there, after receiving a subpoena from the United States government. She lied to Congress, she lied to the FBI, she made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer. The Clinton crew gave more than $675,000 to the wife of the deputy director of the FBI  and the man who was overseeing the investigation into Hillary's illegal server, but maybe that takes care of itself. Right now that takes care of itself I think, I think. Very proud that the FBI was willing to do this actually, really, very proud. \n\nJust yesterday we learned that Bill Clinton's right-hand man pushed for Clinton's foundation donors and other large corporations to funnel as much as $66 million in personal profit to Bill and Hillary Clinton.\n\nThis man explained that the cozy relationship between his consulting firm to foundation and Clinton's personal income had helped Bill and Hillary enrich themselves, and obtain in-kind services, including personal travel, hospitality, vacations, and the like. \n\nThe same people paying Bill Clinton for speeches were lobbying Hillary Clinton at the same the same time, same time. \n\nAnd these people are seriously corrupt. \n\nTerribly conflict. Hillary's pay for play included defense contracts. Take Raytheon, when the contractor wanted big foreign arms deals, they hired three lobbyists that raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for Hillary's last campaign, and are raising money for her current campaign.\n\nAnd by the way 50 to 1 in ads, 50 to 1. And if you look at Florida, we're winning. Ohio, we're winning. Iowa we're winning. \n\nDoing great in New Hampshire. I think we're going to have a tremendous victory in Pennsylvania. \n\nWe better have a great victory in New Hampshire, please. OK, we will. \n\nIn fact when this news when this news of the FBI's investigation, when it just happened a little while ago, they said Mr. Trump, I think they'd understand, we could skip your speech in New Hampshire this is so big. I said I don't have the courage to skip the speech in New Hampshire. Believe me, I don't have the courage. \n\nI'm not skipping New Hampshire, I never will. You know, when I won, and you remember because I go around and we had the big rallies, and they said oh, the big rallies will never work in New Hampshire, you have to sit down and have dinner with everybody. I said that's like that's a lot of dinners. They don't expect that.\n\nBut you remember when we met, and I'd have a lot of small meetings too with people, we'd talk, and New Hampshire more than any other place taught me about drugs flowing into this country. And your police department, so great, the police departments in New Hampshire, they told me. I went to some, I became friendly with some. \n\nAnd I never knew I never knew, honestly, I knew it was bad, I never knew it was so bad. And I said to the people of New Hampshire, because more than any other place, you look at the beautiful little roadways and lakes and streams, and everything is so beautiful, the trees, and you say how could they have a drug problem here? It doesn't fit.\n\nBut I'd sit down with groups, and I said what's your biggest problem? And I figured they'd say maybe the veterans which are suffering greatly in this area, we understand that. But it was always -- and we'll solve that problem. But it was always, you know what, it was always heroine. I'd say heroine? What do you mean? And I learned so much. And I said to the people of New Hampshire that if I win, which I did with New Hampshire, if I win, and I also said and if I go all the way, we are going to stop the inflow of drugs into New Hampshire and into our country 100 percent \n\nAnd I gave the people of New Hampshire my pledge, more than anybody else in this case, because they really taught me about what's happening with the world of drugs pouring in. Hard to believe. It's just so, so strange when you look and see the beauty of this place and then you see that heroin and drugs are your number one problem, by far.\n\nAnyway, with months these lobbyists sealed over $26 billion in foreign arms deals, including over $19 billion in Qatar, some people would say Qatar, which happened to be off Bill Clinton. $1 million as a birthday gift for a few minutes of face time. $1 million. The lobbyists, one of whom was the sister-in-law to Hillary Clinton's current campaign chairman, received hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees, the contractor got billions of dollars in contracts, and Hillary Clinton got her campaign cash and money for her foundation.\n\nAnd you know I'm putting up tremendous amounts of money. Today I wrote another check for $10 million. I'm spending money like crazy. I'll probably have over maybe close to or over $100 million of my money spent on the campaign. But there's something nice about that. Unless I lose, in which case I say, \"What was that all about?\" But we're gonna do what's right for you, not what's right for some contributor or special interest. \n\nHillary put the office of the secretary of state up for sale and if she ever got the chance, believe me she would put the office and you know what office I'm talking about the office called the Oval Office up for sale too. I propose a contract with the American voter which will end corruption and give government back to our great people. I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and heed the words I'm about to say, and I never loved this expression but now I love it because it's become it's become the hottest expression. If we win on November 8th, we are going to Washington, D.C. when we win, OK and we are going to drain the swamp. \n\nAt the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs. You've been suffering with the jobs. The jobs have gone like candy being taken from a baby. New growth numbers just released put the average growth rate for this year at a disastrous 1.5 percent. If China goes down to 7 or 8 percent GDP, you know it's like a national catastrophe. Last quarter we were at 1 percent. Our job numbers last week were horrible. They were anemic, as the expression goes. They like to say anemic, that was the word they used. Obama is the first president in modern history not to have a single year of 3 percent growth.\n\nAnd they say it's hard because we're a large county. Well India is a much larger country and they're at 8 percent. China is at 7 percent. And China's not happy. So we're at around 1 percent and we just keep going along, just keep going along losing our jobs to Mexico and every other place. Forty-seven million Americans are on food stamps, and 45 million people think of it, this is our country are living in poverty.\n\nMeanwhile our trade deficit with the world is now nearly $800 billion a year. You say, \"Who negotiates these contracts?\" We're living through Obama. It's true. You know instead of campaigning for Hillary Clinton he ought to be in the White House in the Oval Office negotiating trade deals, beating ISIS, taking care of our veterans which he does not do. We're living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. They're stealing our jobs. Greatest in the history of the world.\n\nNew Hampshire has lost one in three manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported strongly by Hillary. We've lost 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization, another Bill and Hillary disaster.\n\nThe Trump administration will immediately begin negotiating and we will start this negotiation so fast. We will start a negotiation on NAFTA, and if we don't get the deal we want, we will terminate NAFTA and get a much, much better trade deal. \n\nAnd I won't go into the details, but because they're different tax systems, they're under a VAT system and we're under our system, but because of the fact that they're under a much different tax system, the day the deal was signed it was a defective deal, with us having a massive, at least 17 percent disadvantage.\n\nSo it's complicated. I'm not going to bother you or bore you with it, but we've been working with a defective deal for years, and nobody, no politician ever went back to renegotiate it. We're going to get it done, folks, so easily. \n\nIf a company wants to fire their workers and go to Mexico or another country and then they think they're going to ship their products back into the United States, we will charge them a tax of 35 percent. \n\nSo when you think these companies, which right now are out there negotiating to leave here, they'll leave New Hampshire, they'll leave Pennsylvania, they're gonna leave Ohio, they're gonna leave all of these places, all of our great places and great states. And right now as we're talking, they're negotiating deals.\n\nMexico is the eighth wonder of the world in terms of the new plants. A friend of mine, Bill Plante, he's the biggest, he said the eighth wonder of the world what's happening in Mexico. And I say, and I tell this to people, what about us? He said meh, not gonna be it's gonna be the other way around. \n\nBut there will be consequences. And you know, when they realize that they've got to now pay a tax, all of that, to come through our very strong border, because there will be a strong border  with their product, you know what they're gonna say? They're gonna say let's say, we're not gonna move, and they're gonna stay. It's very simple. But the politicians don't want to do that because they're controlled they're controlled by the people that give them their campaign contributions and probably other things. We will does anybody know what I mean by that? \n\nWe will also stand up to Chinese currency manipulation and we will stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership. \n\nWe will become a rich nation again, but to be a rich nation, we must also be a safe nation. Hillary Clinton unleashed ISIS onto the world and it has now spread into our country. There are right now 1,000 open ISIS investigations across the United States, more than at any time that we've ever had. Now, Hillary wants to increase by 550 percent  the massive number of Syrian refugees flowing into our country. That's over the Obama numbers, and those are thousands and thousands of people. A Trump administration will suspend the Syrian refugee program. \n\nAnd we'll help them will safe havens and we'll get other countries over there, like the Gulf states who have nothing but money, we have $20 trillion in debt. We'll get them to pay, they gotta do their share. We'll lead it, we'll help, they'll pay, but you know what? We can't let people into this country that we don't know about we don't know. \n\nLet me state this as clearly as I can. If I'm elected president, I am going to keep \n\nWhen... \n\nWe love New Hampshire, I love this place. I love this place. By the way, you know, we're leading in Florida, we're leading in all these places. The recent poll said we're two down in New Hampshire. You know what I said? I don't think so, I don't think so. \n\nThese polls, these polls, these are called dirty polls, you know what that is? These are false. I don't think so. She comes up here, she has four people, and it's like oh, we have a wonderful crowd. I don't think so. I think we're winning New Hampshire big.\n\nOK. So we'll change it. When I'm elected president \n\nI am going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. \n\nA Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. Boy, you people have energy, you're great. \n\nWell, let's face it, it's been a long time, right? It's been a long time. You've been waiting a long time for the right person, but you do have energy.\n\nYou know what's happening? A lot of these places\n\nA lot of the different places, reports are coming out. They hate to write it, you know the dishonest media. \n\nBut people by the way, great people, oh they're the worst, they're so dishonest. They are so dishonest, folks. But a lot of these reports coming out in the early voting states, people are coming up that have never voted. These are great Americans, these are great people, but they've just never seen anybody that they wanted to like they've never heard people say we're going to actually bring back your jobs. We're not going to let companies leave us and fire everybody and move and then let the product pour into our country with no tax.\n\nNo, no, just go ahead, leave, fire all our people, move to Mexico, make the product, sell your air conditioners Carrier's an example, they're leaving they might not leave, they're probably all about ready to change their mind. But just let your product come right in, no tax, no nothing. I mean, how stupid is this? How stupid?\n\nAnd I'm a free-trader, I'm a fair trader. But we have the wrong people represent us. So what's happening is these lines in Florida are four blocks long. They were never like that. They've never seen anything like it. And in Tennessee, a great congressman, been there for 25 years, said to me, \"I've never seen we have never seen anything like it.\" \n\nPeople are coming out that haven't voted in years. People are coming out, they literally they hadn't voted in years. So they're not polled because, you know, unless you voted like in the last election, they don't want to poll you. So, people are coming out that hadn't voted in years. Happening in Texas. They haven't voted in years.\n\nAnd people that have never even voted, and yet they're great Americans. They just never saw somebody that they wanted to vote for. And they're coming out and they've got the Trump shirt and they've got the hat, they've got buttons all over the place, you know. \n\nNow, who knows who knows? They may have all of the Trump stuff and you never know. Maybe they're voting for crooked Hillary Clinton, but I don't think so, right? I don't think so. \n\nHistory has taught us that we don't think so. So, I think we're doing great.\n\nAnd yes, on the border, we have no choice, we will build a wall and Mexico will pay for the wall. Got to stop the drugs. \n\nGot to stop the drugs. Remember my pledge to everybody but in particular to New Hampshire, because I know what you're going through with the drugs. I know what your incredible law enforcement, your police and your fire departments, because I see where they're helping so much. Believe me, they're they're not spoken about.\n\nAnd how about where they're shooting? During fires, they're shooting at the firemen. Now, this is a new phenomenon. They're shooting at firemen. They're shooting bullets at firemen going to fires and fighting fires. So we have a divided country and we're going to make our country love again. We're going to bring it like this room. \n\nCountless Americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this administration. This includes incredible Americans like 21-year-old Sarah Root. You've heard that story, you've seen it, you've read about it.\n\nThe man who killed her arrived at the border, entered federal custody and then was released into the United States community under the policies of this White House. He was released again and again, after crime after crime and now is at large. Sarah graduated from college just the day before with a 4.0 grade point average, top in her class. She was violently, violently killed. Outstanding young woman. I know her parents; they're incredible.\n\nAlso among the victims of Obama-Clinton open borders policy was Grant Ronnebeck, a 21-year-old convenience store clerk in Mesa, Arizona. He was murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted of burglary who had also been released from federal custody. And so many people said please, please, please don't release him, he's violent. And he shot Grant through the head.\n\nAnother victim who we've all read about and known about, Kate Steinle, gunned down in the sanctuary city of San Francisco by an illegal immigrant. \n\nAnd this person was deported five previous times. And now, he's got a good lawyer and the case will go on and on and on. He's got a lawyer, I see them in court all the time. The case will go on and on. Shot in the back while standing with her father. Great parents, great brother.\n\nThen there is the case of 90-year-old Earl Olander, who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death in his home. The perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records a mile long but who did not meet the Obama administration's priorities for removal. People begged that they be incarcerated or be moved out of the country, but our geniuses wouldn't listen.\n\nIn California, a 64-year-old Air Force veteran, Marilyn Pharis, was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer. Her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions but was never deported. People asked please, please deport him. This is what happened. This is a crime wave that never ends. I can tell you it's thousands of cases like this.\n\nWhen I'm president, believe me, it will end. \n\nNot only will a wall keep out the dangerous cartels and criminals, but will also keep out the drugs, remember New Hampshire, and the heroin poisoning our youth. Our youth is being poisoned before they get a chance \n\nAnd by the way, I've met plenty of people in New Hampshire that are not our youth that have a tremendous problem, and I want to tell you, we're going to work with people, we're going to set up programs, we're going to try everything we can to get them unaddicted, unaddicted. \n\nSo as I said, when I won the New Hampshire primary, I promised the people of New Hampshire that we would stop drugs from pouring into your community and I guarantee you we will. You will be so proud of your president, you will be so proud of your community. \n\nYou will be so proud.\n\nI just want to say in closing I just want to say in closing that we have an amazing movement going on. A movement like they've never seen before, a movement that hopefully won't be stopped. We have a movement that the biggest people in the world of the media, the biggest, have said they've never seen anything like it before. Every every crowd, every auditorium.\n\nThe other night, we had a situation. We had thousands and thousands of people and I said to the fire marshal, isn't it possible to let more in? We had thousands of people in this massive field and we had many thousands outside of the gates they wouldn't let in and I said, couldn't we let them in? And they said, we can't. I said, but there's no fire, we're outside. He said, it's stampede, Mr. Trump, we're worried about a stampede.\n\nAnd it's a stampede of love. It's true. It's not a stampede it's a stampede of love. \n\nBecause there was so many people. They said we have very strong security guards, but Mr. Trump, they're not nearly strong as 45,000 people come charging forward. So I fully understood it. But we have something going on that's so special. It's so special. We're going to reduce your taxes, we're going to simplify your taxes. We're going to make your businesses welcome in our country. \n\nWe're going to reduce the taxes for middle-income people. We call them the forgotten men and women. Greatly simplify your returns. The only company that I can think of that won't like us is H&R Block, they will not like us.\n\nThey're not gonna like Trump too much.\n\nBut we'll greatly simplify your taxes. And your businesses we're taking it from 35 percent, which is one of the highest in the world, just about the highest, down to one of the lowest in the world, 15 percent. \n\nWe're getting rid of a lot of the regulations that are stopping growth. Tremendous amounts of regulation are killing your small businesses and your big businesses. So we're gonna have a very tax- friendly country again, and it's gonna mean jobs, it's gonna mean expansion, it's gonna mean new companies growing.\n\nWe are going to create the border. We are going to stop the drugs. We're gonna have people come into our country. We want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally. They have to come in through a legal process. We want a lot of people to come in. \n\nAnd they're going to come in, but they'll come in legally. And we're gonna streamline the process. People are waiting on line now 10 years. We're gonna streamline because we want people to come in, but we want them to come in legally. And we want merit, too. We want to take wonderful, great people that love our country, they want to get out and they want to do a great job. We want to have them also come in based on merit. A word you don't hear anymore. A word you don't hear any more. It's too bad.\n\nWe're also going to very importantly appoint justices to the Supreme Court \n\nWho you can be proud of and who will respect the Constitution of the United States. \n\nWe're going to save our Second Amendment, which is under unbelievable siege. \n\nWe're going to help big league on education, we're going to go with choice, so important, and we're going to terminate Common Core and bring education local. \n\nOur military is depleted. We're going to rebuild our military. We are going to lead through strength. \n\nAnd hopefully, we're not gonna have to use our military but I will say this. We're getting rid of ISIS. We're getting rid of ISIS. \n\nISIS is we have no choice. By the way, not since medieval times has anyone seen chopping off of heads, drowning in steel cages, burying in sand. Not since not since medieval times. It all grew during the tenure of Obama and Hillary Clinton.\n\nISIS you know she stands up and she says what she's gonna do. Well, she was there. It came out of the vacuum because we should have never gone into Iraq, but once we did, we should have gone out the right way, not the wrong way. And the way they went out was so bad, so bad, including giving back Mosul, which now they're fighting to take back. And it would have been nice the element of surprise. Do we agree? Does anybody not agree? \n\nThe element of surprise. We don't use the element of surprise. We use the element of tell them everything we can possibly tell them, give them plenty of time to get ready and then attack. And it turns out to be a lot tougher than they ever thought.\n\nBut we're going to have a country that you're going to be proud of again. We're going to have a president that hopefully you will be proud of. \n\nI will work so hard for every community. I'll be working very hard for the African-American community, for the Hispanic community. I'll be working hard for every community. And we're gonna have this divided nation come together. And I just want to say we're gonna make America strong again, we're gonna make America doesn't sound nice, but we have no choice wealthy again. \n\nBut we are going to make America great again. \n\nAnd I want to thank everybody in New Hampshire. Get out and vote. You're very special people. You're very, very special people. God bless you, get out and vote. \n\nThank you. Thank you, New Hampshire.\u0000","2":"I am so excited to be here and I want to thank you. And you know I am really sorry and I know there are a lot of people outdoors who can't get in--so I want to give a big shout out to the overflow outside. I'm here with a lot of great people who are working so hard on this campaign. I want to thank Ken Evans. Thank you so much, Ken. I want to thank three members of Congress: Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz; Congressman Alcee Hastings; and your Congresswoman Lois Frankel. I also want to thank Sheriff Israel for being here. And Mayor Resnick just gave me a key to the city of Wilton Manors. And I want to thank my longtime friend and such a great leader, Chad Griffin, Human Rights Campaign president. I know that Chad told me there are a bunch of Human Rights Campaign organizers. And as I've said many times, HRC for HRC sounds good to me.\nWell, my friends, just nine days left until November the 8th. Nine days that really will determine the outcome of the most important election of our lifetimes. And we cannot take anyone or anything for granted. It's great to be here at the Manor Complex, a place that means so much to so many. And there have been ups and downs in all that we've gone through over the years, and even in this campaign, but I want you to know I am focused on one thing: you - your lives, your futures. The problems that keep you up at night. That's what I'm interested in, and that's what I'm going to be talking about here today and throughout the next nine days.\n\nThat's really what this election is about. There's a lot of noise and distraction, but it really comes down to what kind of future we want and who, as our president, can help us get there. So I want you to know - now, I just have to say I know I'm preaching to the choir. But I also, through you, want to talk to people who are still making up their minds, believe it or not, right? Because we've got a choice between a president who will bring us together, keep our country safe, get the economy working for everyone, not just those at the top - or someone who's temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified for the job. You know, Donald Trump is doing his best to confuse, mislead, and discourage the American people. I mean, he's such a downer, right? And it's time for him to stop fear mongering, stop distracting from what's really at stake, and frankly, stop disgracing our democracy. We can't let him get away with this.\n\nBut here's the good news. Yes, America is great, and we can make it greater if we work together and we set some goals. But we are seeing Americans coming together - Democrats, Republicans, independents - to reject Donald Trump's dark and divisive vision of our country. And it's going to be really important that we make it clear to everyone in these last nine days what's at stake. Because I really believe the vast majority of Americans agree with us. We don't want a president who demeans women. We don't want a president who has plans to break up and deport immigrant families. We don't want a president who perpetrated the lie that President Obama wasn't born in America. We don't want a president who would appoint Supreme Court justices to overturn marriage equality. But I want you to know, the energy we're now seeing out in the campaign is not just about what we're against, it's also about what we're for. Because we also share a common vision. Beyond partisanship and politics, it's a hopeful, inclusive America where everyone counts and everyone has a place, right?\n\nAnd that's exactly what I'm going to be fighting for in these last nine days. We're going to honor people, not insult them. Donald Trump has insulted more than half of our population. African Americans, Latinos, immigrants, Muslims, POWs, women. And by what he has said, so many others who believe that you have a positive future. I agree with that: you do. And I promise you this: I'm going to keep working every single day for you and for the vision of America that we share.\n\nNow, I will tell you, my mom taught me to never, ever quit, and what does that mean? Well, that means -\n\nYou got it. You got it. And it also means when you're knocked down, what matters is whether you get up again. I have been fighting for families and underdogs my entire life. I'm not stopping now. We're just getting warmed up, right? And we won't be distracted, no matter what our opponents throw at us. We're not going to be knocked off course. We know how much this election matters, and we know how many people are counting on us. So we're going to take to heart the words of our wonderful First Lady, Michelle Obama: When they go low, we go high.\n\nWe're going to keep our foot on the gas because Donald Trump's strategy is real simple. They've even said it in his campaign. Here's his strategy about how he's going to win: Get women to stay home. Get young people to stay home. Get people of color to stay home. Get the LGBT committee to say home. It's all part of his scorched earth campaign, and it goes against everything we stand for. So you know how we're going to stop him? By showing up with the biggest turnout in American history.\n\nWe need everybody to turn out and vote - women, young people, people of color, the LGBT community, Latinos, African Americans, Americans from all walks of life. Let's break every single record. Let's make that the story of this election. And here's some really good news. This is amazing. More than 20 million people have already voted in this election, most of those votes in the last few days, 3 million of those votes from right here in Florida. Now, you only see numbers like that when people are standing up for what they really believe in. So if all of you vote, if your friends, your family, your coworkers vote, if everyone you talk to between now and Election Day votes, we are going to make some really big history on November the 8th.\n\nAnd I want you not only coming out for me. I want you to reelect our members of Congress. And please elect Patrick Murphy to the Senate. And if there are still people who have doubts about the stakes in the election, listen to this. We've heard some outrageous things in this campaign. I'm sure we'll hear more in the next nine days. But I got to tell you, I was beginning to think that nothing we learned about Donald Trump could surprise me anymore.\n\nBut yesterday the Washington Post published a report that was truly stunning. It starts with the story of a ribbon-cutting back in 1996 for a nursery school serving children living with HIV and AIDS in New York. Now, let me say, this is important in part to remember. This is a story about children with HIV and AIDS. So there was a big celebration honoring the donors who had supported the nursery school, and all the kids and their families, for whom this was the most important thing you can imagine. Because you know, back in the '90s, some of you remember. Right? Children weren't welcomed in school.\n\nAnd then, unannounced and uninvited, guess who barges in? Donald Trump. He walks right up to the stage. He sat down in the seat that was being saved for a local developer who had made a generous donation. None of the people working for the charity knew why he was there. He wasn't a donor at all. He had never given a single dollar to help build the school. He just wanted people to think he had. So he sat on the stage through the program, even posed for photographs, and when it was over, he got up and walked out. No explanation. No donation. Now really, who does that? What kind of person does that? Really? I mean, who pretends to help kids with HIV and AIDS in order to make themselves look good? Well, I'll tell you: The same kind of person who would pull a bait and switch on a high school chess team.\n\nBack in 1997, he was principal for a day at a public school. That was a program we used to have in New York. The chess team was holding a bake sale to raise money to travel to a tournament. They were $5,000 short. He walked up to them and handed them a fake million dollar bill. At first the kids and their parents were excited. Then they were devastated to learn it was a joke. So he gave them 200 bucks and drove away in his limousine. Now, this story does have a happy ending because a woman read the story about Donald Trump's behavior, called the school, and donated the $5,000. And the coach remembers this woman saying, \"I am ashamed to be the same species as this man.\"\n\nNow, I got to say, any of you see the debates? Well, you know, I stood next to Donald Trump in three debates for four and a half hours, proving conclusively I have the stamina to do this job. Right? But a lot of what we've heard him say is part of a lifelong pattern. And here's what the Washington Post concludes. 'For as long as he has been rich and famous, he has wanted people to believe he is generous. He spent years constructing an image as a philanthropist by appearing at charity events and by making very public, even nationally televised promises, to give his own money away. It was in large part a facade.-- And a months-long investigation by the Washington Post found that Trump had sought credit for charity he had not given or had claimed other people's giving as his own.\n\nNow, of course, because he's refused to release his tax returns, we don't even know if he's ever given anything. But here's what we do know. With Donald, it's always Donald Trump first and everyone else last. He abuses his power. He games the system, and he doesn't care who's left holding the bag.\n\nAnd here's what else we know. Donald Trump has a terrible record on LGBT rights. And this election will determine whether we continue the progress we've made or let it be ripped away. We know Trump has promised he'll appoint Supreme Court justices who will overturn marriage equality and that he will repeal President Obama's executive actions to protect LGBT people from discrimination. And just this week, a new story came out that tells us a lot about how he treats LGBT employees. It's a story of a maintenance worker at one of Trump's golf courses. So I want you just to think.\n\nThis guy works hard. Works with his hands. Probably there 12 hours a day, maybe more, when it's the summer season. After he told his coworkers he was gay, they started harassing him. They called him names. They even threw rocks and golf balls at him. It got so bad he ended up in the hospital. Now, his supervisor saw all of this and did nothing. So finally he went to the police for help. He was too scared even to come back to work. And what did the Trump golf course do? They fired him.\n\nNow, this is a heart-wrenching story on a lot of levels. For starters, it's a painful reminder of the harassment, violence, and discrimination too many LGBT Americans still face every single day. And it's deeply distributing that instead of stepping in to stop this unacceptable behavior, Trump's business punished the victim for coming forward. Now, if that's how Donald Trump runs his business, what does it say about how he would run our country? We've made a lot of progress on LGBT rights, but as that story reminds us, we still have work ahead, don't we?\n\nThere is still no federal law that stops an employer from refusing to hire someone just because he or she is LGBT, or a landlord from refusing to rent an apartment to a transgender tenant, and of course there are still states where you could get married on Saturday, post your Facebook photos on Sunday, and get fired on Monday just because of who you are and who you love. So here's what I'll do as president. We will call on the Congress to pass the Equality Act. And we will then be able to protect LGBT Americans from discrimination in all aspects of our lives. We'll work together to achieve the AIDS-free generation that is within our reach. And we will take on homelessness, bullying, and violence, particularly youth homelessness, which disproportionately hurts LGBT kids. And we are going to end the harmful practice of so-called conversion therapy. LGBT kids don't need to be cured of anything. They just need to be accepted and embraced and respected. And yes, we're going to bring people together to reform our gun laws and keep guns from falling into the wrong hands so that what happened in Orlando can never happen again.\n\nNow, some of you know, Chad Griffin and others know, this issue is really important to me. I traveled to 112 countries as your Secretary of State. I saw how countries around the world treated lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people. And I believe with all my heart America has to lead by example. I want - I want LGBT people in every corner of our country - because don't forget you all living in Wilton Manors have moved far away from a lot of the places where people are still scared today. Right? And we're going to elevate this issue. We're going to talk about it. We're going to reach out.\n\nSo when you vote in this election, remember, it's not just my name on the ballot. It's your future. It's who we are as a country. It's every issue we care about. And make no mistake: LGBT rights are at stake. Dignity and respect for every American is at stake. The future of our economy is at stake.\n\nI believe when the middle class thrives, Americans thrive. And we're going to make America the clean-energy superpower of the 21st Century, too. And if we're serious about supporting a middle class, we're going to be supporting families.\n\nThe other day, I was in Pittsburgh. And there was a woman there with her young child. We've got some folks from Pittsburgh. She was shaking Tim Kaine's hand. And she said to him, \"I came here hoping I could tell you or Secretary Clinton I had my baby three years ago. And the next day, I was fired. It had been a difficult pregnancy. I called to ask if I could take a little time to recover, and the answer was 'No. Don't come back at all.' Nobody, no parent, should ever have to make that kind of choice, but that's also true when we talk about paid family leave, caring for a spouse or a partner, caring for an elderly relative.\n\nI want us to recognize the way we live today. It is no longer the 1950s. We need to support people who are part of committed relationships, of families, of marriages, and give everybody the support you need to actually do what's the most important thing in life. And that is caring for each other. We're going to do everything we can to catch up to the rest of the world: affordable childcare, paid family leave, earned sick days, jobs with rising incomes. We're going to raise the national minimum wage. No one who works full-time should have to raise a family in poverty.\n\nAnd yes, we're going to guarantee equal pay for women's work. We're going to make sure. We're going to make sure that we not only grow the economy but we make it fairer. And I've got to tell you that's such a stark contrast with Trump. He believes if you give the biggest tax cut in American history to the wealthy - that's with trillions of dollars going to the top - that will somehow trickle down. It hasn't worked. It won't work. I believe that we could grow the economy from the middle out and the bottom up. And that's exactly what we're going to do.\n\nSo, my friends, we've got a guy who won't pay his income tax. I mean, I've got to just say when we learned in the debate that he lost a billion dollars and that meant that he didn't pay income tax for like 20 years, he said that was smart. And I thought to myself, how smart do you have to be to lose a billion dollars? I mean, really. And what kind of genius are you to lose a billion dollars while running casinos? But it's serious because it means he's paid zero, zero for our military, our vets, for healthcare, for Pell Grants, for our universities, our colleges, our highways. This is Trump to a T.\n\nThe stories that I told you about him showing up and acting like he's done something, well, he shows up and criticizes our country. He shows up and discriminates against African Americans when he was denying them the right to rent apartments. He chose to make his products in other countries, not America. He's built a career on stiffing small businesses. I take that personally. My dad was a small business owner. I'm sure glad he never got a contract from Donald Trump.\n\nSo, my friends, we've got work to do. And let's get to that work. We've got to make sure that we get everybody out to vote. I want you to be able to say on November 9th you voted for a better future, you voted for a better America. And look how easy it is. It is so easy. Wilton Manors City Hall is just a half a mile down the street from where we are right now. And if you are registered in Broward County, you can go to any early-vote location in the county from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. all week. And if you have been mailed your ballot, make sure you fill it out and mail it back today. You can go to iwillvote.com to confirm your polling place. And make sure you have a plan to vote.\n\nBut, please, also help us in these last nine days. Every phone call you make, every door you knock on will make a difference. So go to hillaryclinton.com. Sign up to volunteer. Take out your phone. Text 'JOIN,' J-O-I-N, to 47246. I don't want anybody waking up on Wednesday morning and seeing the results and getting depressed. I'm against depression. We don't want that to happen in this election. Right?\"\n\nI don't want people to be sad because they didn't do their part. We can't let that happen. And I have to ask you if you - if you know anybody, if you know anybody, who is thinking about voting for Trump, you've got to stage an intervention. Do everything you can to try to convince that person that they surely care about something that Donald Trump is on the wrong side of because I can guarantee you they do because, after all, friends don't let friends vote for Trump. Right?\n\nSo I am so grateful to all of you. Have many of you have already voted? Okay. So, now, how many of you will help us get somebody else to vote? That's what's going to make the difference. Change is coming. Let's make sure it's the right kind of change. The choice is yours. We're going to do everything we can to build a stronger, better, fairer America, coming together, healing the divides among us. And we're going to prove, once and for all, that love trumps Hate. Thank you.\u0000","3":"Thank you. It is so great to be back in Iowa. Spending time in your state has been one of the great joys of this campaign.\nTogether, we are going to win Iowa in November -- and we are going to win the White House, and Make America Great Again.\n\nThe White House will become the People's House. We will tackle and fix the problems that have gone unsolved for years.\n\nWe are going to fix our crumbling infrastructure, renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, free children from failing government schools, eliminate government waste, and create a fair, simple and efficient tax code that adds millions of new jobs.\n\nProsperity will rise, poverty will recede, and wages will finally begin to grow - and they will grow rapidly.\n\nThis is a campaign about big ideas designed to help everyday people.\n\nIn recent days, we've rolled out one new policy idea after another - on taxes, on school choice, on foreign policy, on defeating terrorism, on rebuilding our military, on Veterans care, on unleashing American energy, and on the vital issue of trade.\n\nBy contrast, Hillary Clinton is running a policy-free campaign. She offers no ideas, no solutions, only hatred and derision.\n\nI am running to be a President for all Americans - Democrat, Republican, Independent, everyone. Whether you vote for me, or whether you vote for someone else, I will be your greatest champion.\n\nOur support comes from every part of America, and every walk of life. We have the support of cops and soldiers, carpenters and welders, accountants and lawyers, the young and the old, and millions of working class families all over this nation.\n\nWhile my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable, I call you hardworking American patriots who love your country and want a better future for all of our people.\n\nHer comments displayed the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as Secretary of State, hide and delete her emails, put classified information in the reach of our enemies, lie to Congress, and sell government favors and access through the Clinton Foundation.\n\nIt's this attitude of arrogance that explains why Hillary Clinton made her 13 phones disappear - including with a hammer - so the FBI couldn't see them, and why she bleached her emails after a congressional subpoena. Now the people who destroyed the emails are all pleading the fifth amendment in front of Congress today.\n\nAnyone watching today's hearing in Congress knows that Hillary Clinton's actions are far more corrupt than we even imagined.\n\nThis is a far bigger scandal than Watergate ever was, but with Watergate we had the Justice Department doing its jobs - here we don't have either. This is a scandal that threatens national security and that involves a multimillion dollar pay-for-play scheme between the Secretary of State and her Foundation.\n\nWhether it's her emails, her disasters in Iraq, Libya and Syria, or her failures on the economy, Hillary Clinton lacks the judgement, temperament and moral character to lead this country.\n\nIn the words of a secret service agent posted outside her office: \"she simply lacks the integrity and the temperament to serve in the office-\u00c2\u0089from the bottom of my soul, I know this to be true.\"\n\nThe policies of Hillary Clinton have produced death and destruction overseas, and produced only failing schools, rising crime, job loss, shrinking incomes, and tragic poverty at home.\n\n1 in 5 American households do not have a single member in the labor force. Another 14 million people left the labor force entirely since 2009. And the national debt has doubled to nearly $20 trillion during the Obama Years.\n\nI am running to reverse these policies, and to create a future of prosperity for all Americans.\n\nThat includes our family farms right here in Iowa.\n\nFamily farms are the backbone of this country. We are going to end the EPA intrusion into your family homes and your family farms.\n\nWe are going to protect the Renewable Fuel Standard, corn-based ethanol, eliminate job-killing regulations like the Waters of the U.S. rule, and provide desperately-needed tax relief.\n\nOur plan lowers the tax rate on family farms down to 15 percent, and to stop the double-taxation of family farms at death - helping to ensure that the family farm tradition in Iowa continues to thrive and flourish.\n\nMy economic agenda can be summed up in three words: jobs, jobs, jobs.\n\nThat means we are going to negotiate trade deals to protect our farmers, help them export their goods, and grow family farming in America.\n\nMy first day in office, I am also going to order a review of every single regulation issued over the last eight years. All needless, job-killing regulations will be cancelled. Millions of new jobs will come pouring in.\n\nWe are going to lift the restrictions on American energy - which means lower electricity prices for our farmers, and half a million new jobs a year.\n\nThat's just the beginning.\n\nAlso on my first day, I am going to ask Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare - this will instantly save another 2 million jobs.\n\nBy the way, remember when Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, said the \"lack of transparency,\" was essential to passing the legislation and then he talked about - and I quote - \"the stupidity of the American voter.\" This is the hateful attitude of insiders like Mr. Gruber and Hillary Clinton - and the voters have had enough. They're taking their country back.\n\nAnother major reform is going to be school choice. I've outlined a plan to provide every disadvantaged child in America the freedom to choose the private, public, magnet or religious school of his or her choice.\n\nThis will help lift millions of poor African-American and Hispanic children out of poverty.\n\nIt's time to break-up the failed Democratic control over our inner cities, and provide real hope and opportunity to every single community in this nation.\n\nOur policies on taxes, trade, regulations and education will grow incomes, boost jobs and reduce poverty for our African-American and Hispanic communities.\n\nWe need a new civil rights agenda for our time, one that promises safe neighborhoods, great education, and secure jobs.\n\nNearly 4 in 10 African-American children live in poverty, including 45% of African-American children under the age of six. 58% of African-American youth are not working.\n\nViolent crime rose in America's fifty largest cities last year. Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.\n\nOver 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since January of this year. There's a shooting on average every 2 hours.\n\nTo those suffering and hurting I say: what do you have to lose - vote for Donald J. Trump. I will fix it. I will bring back millions of jobs, higher wages, and great schools.\n\nI will make your communities safe.\n\nSafety also means protecting our people from Radical Islamic Terrorism.\n\nNew video has just been released showing ISIS butchers murdering innocent people in what has been called a Syrian slaughterhouse. The victims were dragged, then hung from meathooks, and then their throats were slit.\n\nThis is an evil, sadistic, monstrous enemy and we must keep these killers out of our country.\n\nWe know that ISIS is trying to infiltrate refugee flows, and to recruit refugees after their entry to our country.\n\nMy opponent wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees. According to the Senate Subcommittee on immigration, her entire plan will bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term and cost $400 billion in lifetime benefits.\n\nInstead of providing free healthcare and jobs to refugees from around the world, we should rebuild our inner cities and help struggling Americans get jobs.\n\nI support the construction of safe zones in the region, and we will get the Gulf States to pay for it.\n\nAt the same time, as we rebuild our military, we are going to get our allies to pay their fair share. Only 5 of the 28 member NATO countries meet their obligation to spend 2% of GDP on defense. I will convene a summit of our European and Asian allies to make sure everyone is sharing in the security burden - and that we are properly focused on Radical Islamic Terrorism.\n\nIn all things, it's time to put Americans first - and start taking care of each other.\n\nTonight, I am going to roll out a plan to help our mothers and our families get affordable, quality childcare for their children.\n\nOn policy after policy, we are going to provide opportunity, prosperity and security for all Americans.\n\nI am going to lower your taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations, on business and in your life; I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare; I'm going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution; I'm going rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; I'm going to save your 2nd amendment. I'm going to stop illegal immigration and drugs coming into our country, and yes, we will build the wall and I'm going to, so importantly, renegotiate your horrible trade deals, especially NAFTA - which is the single worst trade deal ever made by any country anywhere in the world a one-way street for jobs out of the United States - and we will make great trade deals that put the American worker first.\n\nAnd Apple, and our other major companies, will start making their iPhones, computers and other products inside of the United States - not in China, and all over the world.\n\nWe don't make our products anymore in the United States, but we will again - like never before.\n\nWe will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.\n\nAmerican cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.\n\nAmerican steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.\n\nAmerican hands will rebuild this nation - and American energy, mined from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.\n\nWe will put new American metal into the spine of this country.\n\nI will fight for every neglected part of this nation - and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.\n\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\n\nIt is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.\n\nJobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores.\n\nOnce more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.\n\nWe Will Make America Prosperous Again.\n\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\n\nAnd Will Make America Great Again.\n\nThank you, and God Bless!\u0000","4":"Real change also means getting rid of the corruption in Washington.\nAs you have heard, it was just announced yesterday that the FBI is reopening their investigation into the criminal and illegal conduct of Hillary Clinton.\n\nThis is the biggest political scandal since Watergate, and it is everybody's deepest hope that justice, at last, can be delivered.\n\nHillary has nobody but herself to blame for her mounting legal troubles.\n\nHer criminal action was willful, deliberate, intentional and purposeful.\n\nHillary set-up an illegal server for the obvious purpose of shielding her criminal conduct from public disclosure.\n\nShe set-up this illegal server knowing full well that her actions put our national security at risk, and put the safety and security of your children at risk.\n\nTo further cover-up her crimes, she bleached and deleted 33,000 emails after a Congressional Subpoena, made 13 phones disappear - some with a hammer, lied to Congress under oath, lied to the FBI, and then two boxes of email evidence went mysteriously missing.\n\nShe even pretended not to know that the letter \"C\" meant confidential information that was classified.\n\nAs the recent release of a memo from one of Bill Clinton's closest associates demonstrates, the Clintons have turned the government into a scheme for personal profit.\n\nThe Clintons even saw the deadly disaster in Haiti as an opportunity to cash-in.\n\nThe WikiLeaks revelations have revealed a degree of corruption at the highest levels of our government like nothing we've ever seen before - including a candidate who boasts to donors about having a public position for the voters, and a private position for Wall Street.\n\nHillary put the office of Secretary of State up for sale and, if she ever got the chance, she'd put the Oval Office up for sale too.\n\nHillary should have been convicted long ago.\n\nThat the legal process has been taking this long is incredible.\n\nAnd now it's reported that the Department of Justice is fighting the FBI - that's because the Department of Justice is trying to protect her.\n\n97% of Department of Justice employees' presidential contributions went to Hillary Clinton.\n\nThere are those, and I happen to be one of them, who think Hillary offered Lorretta Lynch a reappointment as Attorney General.\n\nPerhaps that was what Bill Clinton was doing in the secret meeting on the tarmac in Arizona.\n\nHe said it was to play golf, but he never played, and it was over 100 degrees.\n\nThis is what we mean when we call it a rigged system.\n\nNow the Attorney General is fighting the FBI for doing what was right - but what should have been done many months ago.\n\nPerhaps, through this other investigation, they found what may be some of the 33,000 missing and deleted emails Hillary tried desperately to destroy, even going so far as to use digital bleach.\n\nThe stakes on November 8th could not be higher.\n\nA vote for Hillary is vote a to surrender our government to public corruption, graft and cronyism that threatens the very foundations of our Constitutional system.\n\nWhat makes us exceptional is that we are a nation of laws, and that we are all equal under those laws - Hillary's corruption shreds that foundational principle.\n\nPublic Corruption is a grave and profound threat to a Democracy.\n\nGovernment corruption spreads outward, like a cancer, and infects the operations of government itself.\n\nIf the corruption is not removed, then the people are not able to have faith in their government.\n\nIt deadens and saps the spirit of civic participation.\n\nCorruption decays our trust in institutions and our legal system.\n\nWhen the outcome is fixed, when the system is rigged, people lose hope. They detach. Our society becomes unplugged and unhinged.\n\nWhen the powerful can get away with anything, because they have the money and the connections to rig the system, then the laws lose their moral authority.\n\nHillary believes money and power - not truth and justice - should rule the day.\n\nAs FDR once said, government by organized money is just as dangerous as government by organized mob.\n\nThis is what we often see in Third World countries - where the governments are often run by a small handful of corrupt people for their personal enrichment.\n\nCorruption is corrosive to every institution of government, and it must be stopped.\n\nRestoring honesty to our government, and the rule of law to our society, will be my highest priority as President.\n\nWe must save the America.\n\nThat is why My Contract With The American Voter begins with a plan to end government corruption and take our country back from the special interests.\n\nI want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and to heed the words I am about to say.\n\nWhen we win on November 8th, We Are Going To Washington, D.C. And We Are Going To DRAIN THE SWAMP.\u0000","5":"Thank you so much, wow, it is great to be here.\nAnd thank you. I am so honored to be introduced by Mae Wiggins and someone who made such a contribution throughout her life as a nurse to so many people and who, as you can tell, just feels still the pain of being rejected on the basis of her race.\n\nIt took a lot of courage to come here, Mae. Thank you. Thank you for being with us.\n\nI also want to thank a long-time friend of mine, a great activist, extraordinary advocate in Congress, and that's U.S. Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton. I want to thank Mayor Allen Thomas for welcoming me here. And either you're all related to him or you think he's doing a good job.\n\nWell, I told him I want to be a good partner with mayors like him. And work to help communities like Greenville that are growing and striving and attracting young people. He told me that the average age in the residents here in Greenville was 26 years old.\n\nI also want to acknowledge Josh Stein, candidate for North Carolina attorney general. Patsy Keever, chair of the North Carolina Democratic Party. And State Senator Don Davis.\n\nAnd I saved the best for last, someone who I've gotten to know over the years; someone who I really look forward to working with. First thing that Congressman Butterfield said to me is \"I have to talk to you about our farmers.\" Very first thing he said. Proceeded to tell me that he was out on a 200-acre sweet potato farm earlier today. We talked about the damage that Hurricane Matthew has done; the lives lost; the homes lost; and also the agricultural damage with all the flooding. And my heart goes out to everyone who has been affected. We've got to be really focused on what we're going to do with this extreme weather. We're getting more of it in more places. And I'm going to make that a priority for my presidency to make sure communities are well prepared. They're resilient. But that we also work to try to limit the damage by taking on the challenge of climate change and changing weather patterns.\n\nAnd nobody knows more about weather than our farmers. And I am very committed to supporting farms of all sizes, but particularly small farms. You know, I think you said the farm you went to this morning, G.K., was 200 acres. You know, that's a lot of land, but that's not a gigantic multi-thousand-acre farm. And sometimes I think that we spend too much time and money looking after the big, giant farms, and not enough taking care of the smaller farms, the family-owned farms, farms that have been in people's families for generations.\n\nAnd I will do my very best working with G.K. and Eleanor and others in Congress to focus federal attention and resources on places that need it. And eastern North Carolina is a place that needs it. There are still too many people who feel like they have been left out and left behind. And so we've got to spend time thinking about how we bring everybody along.\n\nThat is my goal as your president. I want to knock down the barriers that stand in the way of people and places getting ahead. Now also, on a personal note, I was in Arizona last night and had a great rally there. I don't know -- 15,000, 16,000 people. It was just extraordinary. But I was a little anxious during my speech because the Cubs were playing in the World Series.\n\nAnd, you know, I've been a fan all my life; started watching baseball with my dad; went to Wrigley Field. And, you know, it's been a long time, 108 years, to win a championship and make history. And I only wish that my late father and the great Ernie Banks, Mr. Cub, could have seen it happen. So last night was very special on lots of fronts. And who knows? Maybe we'll see even more history made in a few days. You know, the last time the Cubs won, women couldn't vote. And I think women are making up for that in this election.\n\nSo thank you. Thank you so much for being here. Are you ready to vote? How many -- how many folks have already voted? \n\nWell, that's really impressive. Are you ready to volunteer these last few days? Are you ready to elect Ray Cooper your governor? Have a governor who puts families first and your needs. I know he'll do a terrific job.\n\nAre you ready to elect Deborah Ross to the United States Senate? She will be the independent voice that North Carolina families deserve. And unlike her opponent, she's never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump. And then, are you ready to elect our next president and commander in chief?\n\nYou know, did any of you -- any of you see those debates? Well, you know, I spent four-and-a-half hours standing next to Donald Trump, proving conclusively I have the stamina to be the next president and commander in chief.\n\nBut, you know, he kept saying things like, \"Well, you know, what have you done for 30 years?\" Well, we know what he's done for 30 years, starting with discriminating against African Americans and denying them housing back in the 1970s.\n\nI chose a different path. I have spent my career fighting for kids and families. And I helped to create the Children's Health Insurance Program as first lady. That now provides healthcare to 8 million children a year. And I have to tell you, I know it doesn't make headlines. It's not going to, you know, get a big Twitter war going, but when I travel around and shake hands like I'll do after my remarks, and somebody says to me, \"The Children's Health Insurance Program saved my son's life.\" I met a woman here in North Carolina whose daughter was born deaf. And the doctor said, \"You know, she's never, ever going to be able to talk; she's not ever going to be able to hear.\" Her mother, who is determined, began doing investigations; she found out that there were some possible treatments. But they were expensive. She didn't know what she was going to do. And she took her daughter to the doctor and the doctor said \"I just heard about this new program, the children's health insurance program. Maybe you can qualify for that.\"\n\nBecause it's really for families that aren't poor, but don't have much money, and a lot of families isn't it. And families that don't have an employer that provides health insurance, self employed, independent contractors.\n\nSo, the mom found out about this thing call the children's health program and low and behold they did qualify and they started the treatments for their daughter. I met that young woman, and she said hello to me and she talked to me. She just graduated from college, right here in North Carolina. So don't let anybody tell you, it doesn't matter what you stand for, what you fight for, and who you are trying to help. When you make your decision about who to vote for in this election.\n\nAs a Senator from New York I worked to rebuild New York City after the 9\/11 attacks and to provide healthcare to the brave first responders who ran toward danger not away from it. And many of them--\n\n \n\n Where you there? God bless you. That's another thing, I meet people all over who were there, and who worked there and I meet people who got sick because they worked there. And as your Secretary of State, I traveled to 112 countries negotiated cease fires, reduced the threat of nuclear weapons, stood up for human rights and women's right and LGBT rights around the world.\n\nAnd everything I've done, it's because I've been listening to people and again I know that's not very exciting. I plead to that. You spend time listening not talking, you know, what are the poor journalists going to say, \"Uh, there Hillary Clinton was listening again,\" right?\n\nBut I'll tell you it is what motivates me to hear people's stories, to hear the tribulations and triumphs. You get good ideas. Bring people together; find common ground, even with people we disagree with. I disagree with people on lots of issues, but I believe the only way we can get things done is to actually listen and respect each other, and try to find common that common ground. And that will enable us to get results for people. And if you elect me next Tuesday that is the kind of President I'll be.\n\nAnd from the first day of this campaign, I've been telling you what I want to do. Putting forth my ideas about what I think will help you. I truly believe that you deserve a candidate that you can vote for, not just someone to vote against. And so if we are gonna make this choice we have got to be clear. The positives and the negatives, because one way or the other, come this January, America is going to have a new President. And it will be either me or Donald Trump.\n\nAnd you know what else? People say all the time, you know I want change, will come, that is certain. The question is what kind of change are we going to have. Are we going to work together to build a stronger fairer better America, or are we going to fear the future and fear each other and hunker down and be paralyzed by all of our prejudices, our discrimination that stops us from coming together? So, here is what I want you to do in these next days as you talk with people who maybe haven't yet voted, maybe haven't yet made up their mind. I want you to ask them, imagine it is January 20th, 2017 and it is Donald Trump standing in front of the capital taking the Oath of Office.\n\nImagine what that will be like to have him in the Oval Office, making the decisions that effect your lives and your futures. Imagine having a president who demeans women, mocks the disabled, insults African Americans and Latinos. Who pits people against each other instead of pulling them together. Someone who always puts himself first and doesn't care who gets hurt along the way\n\nA president with a very thin skin, who lashes out at anyone who challenges him. Who praises adversaries like Vladimir Putin and picks fights with our allies and even attacked the Pope. The truth is we don't have to imagine what that would be like, because everything that Donald Trump has said and done, both in his career and in his campaign, is a preview of what could happen.\n\nYou know as Michelle Obama says, the presidency doesn't change who you are, it reveals who you are. And we have all see all we need of Donald Trump. If Donald Trump were to win this election, we would have a commander and chief who is completely out of his depth and whose ideas are incredibly dangerous. Someone who wants more countries to have nuclear weapons, and who could easily insult a foreign leader and start a real war instead of just a twitter war. And yet this morning in Florida, Donald stood on a stage and said and I quote \"I am honored to have the greatest temperament that anyone has ever had\". Now -- he knows we can see and hear him, right?\n\nThis is someone who at another rally, yesterday, actually said out loud to himself, stay on point Donald, Stay on point. His campaign probably put that in the teleprompters, stay on point Donald, stay on point. You know, we have seen it over and over again. We know his true self. His instinct is to say whatever pops into his head, no matter how wrong he is. He can't help himself. So is this someone we want to put in charge of our military?\n\nIs this someone that we want to treat people the way he has demonstrated, his disrespect throughout this campaign. In a country that values, religious liberty and freedom. Someone who would ban every Muslim in the world from ever coming to our country. Someone who thinks the lives of black people are all crime and poverty and despair. He has no idea, none, about the strength of the black church, the vibrancy of black owned businesses, the excellence of historically black colleges and universities, the rise of a new generation of black activists for social justice and the success of black leaders in every field. Remember how he denied housing to Mae Brown Wiggins. And Mae wasn't alone. Whenever African Americans tried to rent an apartment, their application was marked with a \"C\" -- \"C\" for colored.\n\nIn fact, Donald, his father Fred and their entire company were sued by the Justice Department for discriminating against African Americans and Latinos in the 1970s. They settled the case, but the Justice Department was forced to go after them again because they continued to discriminate against people of color. Think about that. If he were to win, he would be in charge of the federal housing department. If he doesn't respect all Americans, how can we trust him to serve all Americans?\n\nAnd then another recent example is the way Donald Trump treated what are called the \"Central Park Five.\" These were five black and Latino kids, some as young as 14. Who, it turns out, were wrongly convicted of a terrible crime in New York back in 1990.\n\nDonald Trump took out full-page ads in four newspapers calling for the death penalty for these kids. Nearly three decades later, they were exonerated by DNA evidence. Also, someone else confessed to the crime. So they were finally released from prison and justice was done, but not only did Donald Trump refuse to apologize for calling for their execution, he actually said they should still be in prison.\n\nTo him, those kids will still and always be guilty no matter what the evidence says. Do we want this man appointing judges? Do we want him controlling the Justice Department?\n\n No!\n\n Well, people who are voting for him, that's what they would get. He has spent this entire campaign offering a dog whistle to his most hateful supporters. He retweets white supremacists and spreads racially tinged conspiracy theories. And you better believe he's being heard loudly and clearly.\n\nJust a few days ago, and I want you to hear this because this has never happened to a major -- to a nominee of a major party. Just a few days ago, Donald Trump was endorsed by the official newspaper of the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nThey wrote their endorsement under the slogan of his campaign, \"Make America Great Again.\" They said it's about preserving white identity. And they placed their faith and hope in him. You've got to ask yourself: Do any of us -- any of us who believe in our Constitution, who believe in the rule of law, who believe that we are stronger together, who believe that we want to keep moving positively toward the vision of freedom and equality set forth by our founders -- do any of us have a place in Trump's America?\n\nIt's not just about communities of color. It's about young people. It's about any of us who don't ever want us to go back to a time when you could officially discriminate; where people could be intimidated. That is not who America is and we're not going to let it ever go back to that.\n\nBut it doesn't end there. You've also got to ask: Do women and girls have a place either? Imagine our daughters, or in my case now my granddaughter, growing up with someone who ranks women by their looks; gives them numbers and brags about doing things to them without their consent. Just imagine what that would mean to young women's confidence and self-worth. And how that will affect our young men and boys, who we want to teach and nurture also to respect each other and respect girls and women as well.\n\nSo, this is a pretty clear choice, North Carolina. I've said many times in this campaign that Donald Trump has showed us who he is. Now we have to decide who we are. Right?\n\nAnd across America, people are doing just that -- rejecting Trump's dark and divisive vision for one that is much more hopeful, inclusive and unifying. We know that America is big-hearted, not small-minded. We want to lift people up, not tear people down.\n\nWe are called -- we are called. In fact, we are commanded, those of us who are Christians, to love our neighbor as ourselves, aren't we? We are not asked, we are not requested, we are not urged -- we are commanded. And we know how hard that is. When I used to teach Sunday School, I often taught on that, not because it was well known, but because I think it's so hard and challenging.\n\nLove your neighbor as yourself? Well, first, you've got to love yourself. You've got to respect yourself. And then you have to love your neighbor as yourself. I believe with all my heart that we are better than this. And that's why I want to paint a different picture. Because here's what we're going to do if we win this election. We're going to take on systemic racism with a full commitment and real follow through.\n\nWe are not going to accept the status quo. What happened to that church in Mississippi yesterday should not be normal. People painted \"vote Trump\" on the side. And then they set it on fire. Who would do that to a house of worship? In America, that can never be acceptable. What happened in Flint, Michigan should not be normal or acceptable -- little babies, toddlers, children drinking water that was poisoning them. And there are too many young African Americans who are dying either in police incidents or from random gun violence. You know their names: Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner, Sander Bland, Key Scott. So many. We can't accept that as normal either.\n\nSo we are going to get to work. I'm just telling you. If I'm fortunate enough to be your president, we're going to roll up our sleeves and get to work, because that's when we're at our best, solving our problems.\n\nWe're going to dismantle the so-called school-to-prison pipeline and replace it with a cradle-to-career pipeline for every child in this country. I want to make sure that our kids have the chance to thrive with good schools and good teachers no matter what ZIP code they live in.\n\nWe will reform our criminal justice system from end to end. It is wrong. And I don't care whether you are black or white. It is wrong that black men are far more likely to be stopped by police, charged and sentenced to longer prison terms than white men for the same crimes. It's wrong, and we're going to do something about that. And Donald Trump, whenever he's face with these issues says \"well the answer to our problems is more law and order.\" He doesn't tell you what he means by that, but it's kind of code for fear and division. What I think we need to do, is to work together to restore trust between our police and our communities.\n\nI think we are all safer when everyone has respect for the law, and everyone is respected by the law. And it's not all, we are going to take common sense steps to reduce gun violence and save lives, because right now, we've got too many people who should not have excess to weapons: the mentally ill, felons, domestic abusers, terrorists. You know, we can't just bow down and say theres nothing we can do, commensurate with the second amendment. Donald's always trying to say \"oh, you know, she's going to repeal the second amendment.\" What nonsense. Absolute nonsense. But I believe we can respect and honor the second amendment, and keep people safer by keeping guns out of the wrong hands.\n\nAnd we're going to make significant investments in communities that have been let down and left behind. Congressman Butterfield and I were talking about this. There's some good ideas in the Congress to focus on communities, white, black, Latino, Native American, wherever they might be that have been left out. We need to get the engine of economic growth going, because we believe that we should have an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. We believe that we should raise the national minimum wage, because anyone who works full time in poverty should not be mired and left behind. And I think not only do Americans deserve a raise, which Donald doesn't agree with and wanted to eliminate the national minimum wage, I think it's finally time for women to get equal pay for the work we do.\n\nI don't know about you, but this is not just a women's issue. I'm always accused by Donald and his supporters, that whenever I talk like that, I'm playing the woman's card. Well, I've always said, if that's playing the woman's card, deal me in, you got that right.\n\nBut I actually think I'm playing the family economics card, because if you have a mother, a wife, a sister or a daughter, she deserves to be paid fairly for what she does in the work force.\n\nAnd we're going to have a big investments in new jobs, infrastructure jobs, our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports, our water systems. And we're going to do more to bring advanced manufacturing to inner cities and rural communities. Put people to work, doing work that has a really productive purpose. We're going to invest in more clean, renewable energy jobs, these are jobs that cannot be exported, they have to be done right here in eastern North Carolina.\n\nNow it's fair to say \"Ok, that sounds good, how are you going to do all that?\" Ok, I'll tell you two things. First, I have said, and you can hold me to it, I will not - will not raise taxes on anyone making less than $250,00 a year. You see, I come from the middle class. My dad never made anything near that, even in those dollars back in those days. But I know that the best way to grow our economy is from the middle out and the bottom up. Not the top down, that does not work for most Americans. And so, secondly, I'm going where the money is. The money has gone to the wealthiest of Americans and big corporations in the last 15 years. And if you ask Donald Trump what is his economic policy? It is to give trillions - trillions of dollars in tax cuts to himself, to his family, to the wealthy, to corporations. I just think that's a bad, bad idea.\n\nWe're going to make the wealthy pay their fair share, and we're going to make sure Wall Street never threatens Main Street again. And we're going to make public colleges like East Carolina University tuition-free. Tuition-free for working and middle class families, and debt free for everybody else. And if you're struggling with student debt, we have a plan to ease that burden and cut your bills, and get you out from under debt. And we're going to create $25 billion fund specifically aimed at supporting historically black colleges and universities.\n\nBut I don't think that every young person needs to go college. If you want to, I'm going to make it affordable for you, but if you also want some other way of making a good living, let's bring technical education back into high schools and connect them up with community colleges and business apprenticeships.\n\nThere is such a stark difference on every issue that matters between me and my opponent, and I'm asking folks who are still making up their minds to really search your heart about what kind of country we are, and what kind of future we want. I just don't believe we're at our best when we stoke fear about each other. Now, that does not mean we have to agree about everything, of course not. But it does mean we have to be willing to listen and to come together to solve problems that affect us individually and as a society.\n\nI don't think I have all the answers, I don't think anybody does. When Donald Trump at his conventions said he alone could fix everything in America, I thought about our founders meeting in Philadelphia. It wasn't one person creating our country, it was many people working together. Think about every social movement, every economic advance, every university like this one, every achievement that you've made in your own life, somebody helped you. You worked with somebody. Look at this community. Everybody working together, making Greenville really grow and thrive, making this university better and better every single year. That is my experience of America, so here's what I hope you will do. I hope you will get everybody you know, and yourselves , if you haven't voted yet, to vote early. Because the other's strategy is to scare people and intimidate people from going to the polls. Now, Donald Trump's campaign knows that if women turn out, if people of color turn out, if young people turn out, if people who share our vision of a positive unified country, turnout, there's no way he can win, because that is more than half the people in America.\n\nYou may have noticed that President Obama was in Chapel Hill yesterday. He's coming back to North Carolina tomorrow, because he know how hard it is to get anything done in Washington. As he said yesterday, everything we've done is dependent on him being to pass the baton to somebody who believes in the same things he does. Well I'll tell you what, I'm ready to grab that baton. He's going to have to bend down for me to be able to reach it, because you know he's a tall man. But I've been practicing. I spent four years working with him. I call him my partner and my friend, and I am ready to defend and build on his progress, coming out of his eight years of the presidency.\n\nSo let's get out and vote, and let's vote for the kind of future that we want, the kind of country that we want. Find your early voting location for the next three days, please, go take people there. We will show once and for all, love trumps hate, thank you all.\u0000","6":"Thank you. I am so thrilled to be here in Reno\nWith your help, in 34 days, we are going to win this state, we are going to win the White House, and we are going to bring back our jobs.\n\nWe are going to make America rich again.\n\nI am going to end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, keep jobs from pouring out of our country, renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, and massively reduce taxes and regulations on our workers and our small businesses.\n\nHillary Clinton has been there for 30 years, and hasn't fixed anything. In fact, she's just made things worse - it's been 30 years of failure.\n\nThe problems we face as a country are immense, and it is going to take bold action to turn things around.\n\nRight now, we owe $20 trillion in debt. It doubled under President Obama.\n\nOur infrastructure is like that of a third-world country.\n\nThe homicide rate last year experienced the biggest single-year increase in 45 years.\n\nHeroin overdoses are surging, and meth overdoses in Nevada are up 22 percent.\n\nThousands of refugees are being admitted, with no way to screen them, and are instantly made eligible for welfare and free healthcare - even as our own Veterans die waiting for the medical care they need.\n\nOur annual trade deficit with the world is nearly $800 billion a year.\n\nThe federal budget is a disaster. Our State Department, mostly under the watch of Hillary Clinton, misplaced or lost $6 billion in taxpayer funds.\n\nWe have the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.\n\nOn top of it all, our taxpaying citizens send troops and foreign aid all over the world even as their own cities can't provide the most basic services.\n\nAmerica needs a turnaround.\n\nAmerica needs a comeback.\n\nAmerica needs a change.\n\nAnd that change is coming on November 8th. We are going to show the whole world that America is back - bigger, and better, and stronger than ever before.\n\nFirst, we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare.\n\nPresident Bill Clinton has come out and told the truth about Obamacare.\n\nTwo days ago, Bill Clinton torched President Obama's signature legislation. Remember, Hillary Clinton called Obamacare \"one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, of the Democratic Party, and of our country.\"\n\nBill has a different view. Here is what bill said:\n\nHe just said it's a \"crazy system,\" and that \"it's the craziest thing in the world.\"\n\nBill said:\n\n\"people out there  busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week,  wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half--the people getting killed in this deal are the small business people and the individuals who make just a bit too much money to get any of these subsidies.\" Clinton added that it \"doesn't make any sense,\" and that \"the insurance model doesn't work.\"\n\nThere is only one way to stop Obamacare: to vote for Trump. The deadline to register to vote by mail is October 8th. The deadline to register to vote online or in-person is October 18th. And early voting begins on the 22nd.\n\nWith your votes, you will also be voting to protect the 2nd amendment rights of every law-abiding gun-owner in Nevada. Hillary wants to effectively abolish the 2nd amendment, by overturning D.C. vs. Heller and declaring that guns are not a private right. We are also going to conserve your land and natural resources for hunters, anglers, and all who enjoy the outdoors.\n\nFixing our trade deals will be the foundation of our economic revival\n\nMy economic agenda can be summed up with three very simple words: jobs, jobs, jobs.\n\nBut to bring back our jobs, we must fix our trade deals - and stand up to countries that cheat.\n\nChina, Japan, and Europe are printing huge sums of money - the devaluation of currencies is staggering as to what it represents for our country, our businesses, and our citizens.\n\nWe're not on a level playing field, and our politicians don't understand what is going on.\n\nOur jobs are being lost in massive numbers, and we are not making things in America anymore. Too much is being made in other countries.\n\nWhen I am President, we will start making things in America again.\n\nOur nation has lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton's NAFTA - a deal supported by Hillary Clinton. Hillary's Korea deal also cost us another 100,000 jobs.\n\nSince China entered the World Trade Organization - another Bill and Hillary-backed deal - 70,000 factories have shut down or left the United States.\n\nThat's 15 factories closing a day, on average.\n\nThe jobs are leaving Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Hampshire, Michigan, Illinois, Virginia, and all across this country. I'm going to stop the jobs from leaving our country - and I'm going to bring millions of new jobs back into our country.\n\nIt's going to be a new day in America.\n\nFor too long, we've rebuilt other countries at the expense of our own.\n\nSkyscrapers go up in Beijing, while plants and factories crumble in the United States.\n\nCompanies like Carrier, General Electric, Motorola, Mattel, Fiat Chrysler, and so many others are moving their jobs to Mexico, and to other countries.\n\nAnd now, Ford has announced it's moving all of its small car production to Mexico also.\n\nWe are going to renegotiate NAFTA and if we don't get the deal we want, we will withdraw from NAFTA and start over to get a much better deal for our workers.\n\nWe will also lower taxes on American business, from 35% to 15%, and we will have the largest regulatory reform in American history.\n\nThousands of new companies, millions of new jobs, and trillions of dollars in new wealth will come pouring into the United States.\n\nBut to be a rich nation, we must also be a secure nation.\n\nSecurity begins at the border.\n\nHillary Clinton is unfit to be President because she supports open borders.\n\nIn fact, as Secretary of State, she allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be freed into our country because their own countries wouldn't take them back -- it was her job to cancel visas to countries that refused to take back their criminals.\n\nBut she didn't do it.\n\nThe ICE officers, who endorsed me - their first endorsement of a candidate ever - issued a lengthy statement on Hillary Clinton's immigration plans.\n\nLet me read from it.\n\nAgain, this all a quote from the ICE officers: \"Hillary Clinton has promised the most radical immigration proposal in U.S. history.\"\n\n\"Her radical plan would result in the loss of thousands of innocent American lives, mass victimization and death for many attempting to immigrate to the United States, the total gutting of interior enforcement, the handcuffing of ICE officers, and an uncontrollable flood of illegal immigrants across U.S. borders.\"\n\nTheir quote continues.\n\n\"She proposes to keep and expand executive amnesty, to expand catch- and-release, to expand President Obama's non-enforcement priorities to the point where there is virtually no real immigration enforcement or policing of visa overstays, to support Sanctuary Cities, to extend Obamacare to illegal immigrants, to grant amnesty within 100 days, to extend Social Security and Medicare to illegal immigrants through amnesty, plus a 550% increase in the admission of Syrian refugees.\"\n\nThe ICE officers conclude by saying: \"Her plan is total amnesty plus open borders.\"\n\nThat whole quote is from the nation's Immigration and Customs Enforcement Officers. In short, Hillary's immigration stance is disqualifying.\n\nThe first duty of the President of the United States is to protect the citizens of the United States - anyone who fails to understand that is unworthy to lead this nation.\n\nThere are more than 2 million criminal aliens with convictions in the country right now, and many more criminal illegal immigrants who have committed severe offenses but escaped the law entirely - when I am President, we are getting them out, and we are getting them out quickly.\n\nAt the same time, our country is being infiltrated by terrorists.\n\nHundreds of immigrants from high-risk regions have been implicated in terrorism inside the United States since 9\/11.\n\nThe terrorists who planted the bombs in New York and New Jersey, and who carried out the mall stabbing in Minnesota, were foreign nationals admitted into our country - as was the mall shooter in Washington State.\n\nThe Boston Bombers were here on asylum. The San Bernardino Shooter was here on a fiance visa from Saudi Arabia. The Orlando shooter was the son of a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan.\n\nYet, Hillary Clinton wants a 550% increase in Syrian Refugees.\n\nI am not running to be President of the world. I am running to be President of the United States. I am for America First.\n\nWe are going to build a border wall, enforce our laws, and keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country.\n\nWe are also going to end the government corruption\n\nHillary Clinton put her emails on an illegal secret server open to foreign hacking. Then she bleached and destroyed 33,000 emails - after a congressional subpoena. She lied to Congress, under oath, and her staffers took the Fifth Amendment and got immunity deals.\n\nIt's worse than Watergate.\n\nHillary Clinton put her public office up for sale and, if she ever got the chance, she'd put the Oval Office up for sale too.\n\nNow we have learned that the FBI made a side deal with Clinton's top aides to DESTROY their laptops.\n\nHillary Clinton is the ringleader of a criminal enterprise and the only way to deliver justice is to show up and vote.\n\nWe are also going to fix our inner cities, and help Latino Americans\n\n45% of African-American children under the age of 6 live in poverty.\n\n58% of African-American youth don't have jobs.\n\nMore than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.\n\nThe Democrats, like Hillary Clinton, have run the inner cities for 50 years, sixty years, seventy years or more. They've produced only more joblessness, failing schools, and rising crime.\n\nTo those African-Americans suffering in our country I say: What do you have to lose? Vote For Donald Trump. I will fix it.\n\nI will be your greatest champion, and I will deliver real change and justice in your communities.\n\nI am also going to fight to help millions of Latinos trapped in poverty, and fight to provide school choice to every low-income African-American and Latino child in this nation.\n\nHere are some more amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:\n\nWe are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; lift restrictions on all sources of American energy, and put the miners and steelworkers back to work; end Common Core; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; save the 2ndamendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\n\nThis Election Day, you have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this country.\n\nOn November 8th, the arrogance of Washington D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.\n\nThe failed and corrupt political establishment will be replaced with a new government of, by and for the people.\n\nI am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation - and I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.\n\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\n\nYou're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this day. This is a movement like you've never seen before. We're going to make history together.\n\nYou're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote I've ever cast for anyone at any time.\n\nA vote for me is a vote for change, and a vote for me is really a vote for you. You are voting to believe in yourselves. You are voting to believe in your future. You are voting to believe in your country.\n\nAll together, we are going to -\n\nMake America wealthy again.\n\nWe are going to make America strong again.\n\nWe are going to make America safe again.\n\nAnd we are going to make America great again.\u0000","7":"Thank you. Thank you. \nI love that sign, \"Blacks for Trump.\" I love that sign, thank you. \n\nThere are a lot of those signs. Thank you. \"Women for Trump.\" \n\n\"Hispanics for Trump.\" \n\nThere's one \"Women and Hispanics for Trump.\" \n\nThank you very much. In six days, we are going to win the great state of Florida and we are going to win back the White House 100 percent. \n\nWe're on the cusp of an incredible historic change that transfers power from a failed political establishment and returns that power to our families, communities and citizens, to you.\n\nThe system is rigged, remember that. The system is rigged. Right now it's rigged. We're going to change it.\n\nThere's some breaking news about that subject that we're going to discuss right now. As I mentioned yesterday, on of the--and you probably saw this and maybe some of you have just read it.one of the top Department of Justice officials involved in the e-mail investigation, Assistant Attorney General Peter Kassig \n\nis a close associate of John Podesta. The two met for dinner after Clinton testified about Benghazi and Podesta, who by the way said Hillary Clinton has terrible instincts on WikiLeaks, described him as the man who kept him, Podesta, out of jail.\n\nKadzik is also the one who helped lead the effort to confirm Attorney General Loretta Lynch. Now, today, in a newly released e- mail--through WikiLeaks again--we learned that Kadzik was feeding information about the investigation into the Clinton campaign and that \n\nright? And that Kadzik said quote \"It will be a while before the State Department posts the e-mails.\" Remember they were waiting for the e-mails. \n\nPodesta forwarded the e-mails to Clinton's top staff and said, additional chances for mischief. These are the people that want to run our country, folks. \n\nThe spread of political agendas into the Justice Department--there's never been a thing like this that has happened in our country's history--is one of the saddest things that has happened to our country. But with your vote you can beat the system, the rigged system, and deliver justice. So, show up early and vote. Show up early. You know, the lines are incredible. The polls are all saying we're going to win Florida. Don't believe it. Don't believe it. Get out there and vote. Pretend we're slightly behind. You got to get--we don't want to blow this.\n\nThis is the one chance we have, it'll never happen again. It's not going to happen. In four years, it's not going to happen--it can't happen again. This is a movement like we have never seen in this country before. These crowds, the enthusiasm, the love. \n\nGot to get out and vote. Real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing Obamacare. \n\nAnd Hillary is not going to be the answer because she wants to make it more expensive. She's doubling down. It's just been announced that the residents of Florida--sorry to tell you this, folks--are going to experience a massive, massive double digit premium hike. \n\nNow, I know what that hike is, but I want you to leave here happy, I want you to be happy people. I want you to think about the future after we take back the White House so I'm not going to tell you what your hike is, but let me just say it's going to be very substantial. And Obamacare doesn't work on top of everything else. As an example, in the great state of Arizona--which I just left--premiums are going up more than 116 percent. It's out of control.\n\nOver 90 percent of the counties in Florida are losing Obamacare insurance next year. Lots of luck in your negotiation. In Minnesota where the premium increase will be close to 60 percent, the Democratic governor said, the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable. Premiums are surging, companies are leaving, insurers are fleeing, doctors are quitting and deductibles are absolutely through the roof. Wasn't supposed to be like this, but I said it was going to be like this before it was passed because I understand how business works.\n\nObamacare never had a chance. It's a catastrophe. Yet Hillary Clinton wants to double down on Obamacare making it even more expensive. It's going to go up a lot. People aren't going to be able to afford it so I'm not sure that it matters, they're just not going to be able to pay. I'm asking for your vote so we can replace Obamacare and save health care for every family in Florida and the United States. \n\nReal change also means restoring honesty to our government. As you know, the FBI has--did you hear about this little event? The FBI re-opening the investigation. \n\nThey're re-opening the investigation into Crooked Hillary Clinton. \n\nCrooked Hillary, she's crooked. \n\nLock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!\n\nShe is a crooked one, there's no question. Crooked Hillary Clinton, you know that term has really stuck, everyone's calling her--has anyone seen Crooked Hillary Clinton today? \n\nThat's going to be a great term for a president, right? Boy, oh boy, what a mess. This is the biggest scandal since Watergate. And now it's been reported that there are FBI inquiries probing virtually all of Hillary Clinton's inner circle and many of the things she's done over the years. It's about time. Remember, it's a rigged system, remember it's about time.\n\nShe wants to blame everyone else for her mounting legal troubles, but she really has no one to blame but herself. Hillary is the one who set up the illegal private e-mail server to shield her criminal activity. The woman screaming exactly, exactly, it is exactly. Hillary is the one who engaged in a corrupt pay-for-play scheme at the State Department and who ripped off the people of Haiti, the people of Haiti were ripped off. \n\nAnd I met with the people of Little Haiti. Anybody here?\n\nThese are great people, great, thank you.\n\nHillary is the one who endangered national security by sending classified information on an insecure server. Hillary is the one who lied so many times to Congress and the FBI. Hillary is the one who made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer. \n\nAnd she's the one who destroyed 33,000 e-mails after receiving a Congressional subpoena. \n\nShe also accepted debate questions given to her in advance by Donna Brazile \n\nand then used those debate questions to cheat. It's cheating, the worst level. Instead of reporting this breach to an ethics committee or whoever would listen to the breach. So she got the answers, cheating. She got the questions, cheating. And then she--rather than reporting them, rather than saying this shouldn't be happening--she used them against Bernie Sanders.\n\nCan you imagine. she probably got them against me too except we won the debate so easy I don't think it mattered. We won those debates. \n\nDid you see her at the end of the debates? Folks, she was exhausted. You know what she did? She immediately went home and went to sleep. \n\nHillary is not the victim, and the American people, frankly, are the victims of this rigged and corrupt system in every way. But this is your chance finally to change it, November 8th. Now in Florida's case, earlier. Now, just so you understand, record turnout, unbelievable numbers, unbelievable. We're doing great with the African-American community. \n\nWe're doing great with the Hispanic community. \n\nAnd the lines are four, five and six blocks long. They've never seen anything like it. And the polls have just come up. We're way up in Florida. I shouldn't say that, because I want you to go vote. \n\nOK, ready? We're going to pretend we're down. We're down. Pretend, right? We'll pretend we're down. No, we got to win. We got to win big. We got to beat her. Got to beat her. We're up in Ohio, we're up in Iowa, we're up in North Carolina. \n\nI think we're doing great in Pennsylvania; from what I hear. \n\nFolks, you're going to be so proud. You're going to be so proud. We're going to make America great again. You're going to be so happy and you're going to be so proud of your country again.\n\nIf Hillary Clinton were to be elected, it would create an unprecedented and protracted constitutional crisis. \n\nHaven't we just been through a lot with the Clintons, right? Remember when he was impeached for lying? He can't practice law. He doesn't have the right to practice law. Didn't we just go through this? And the last thing we need is another four years of Obama. That's the last thing. \n\nAnd this will be worse. That means ISIS, that means high taxes, that means bad health care, that means no border. Without a border, we don't have a country. The work of government would grind to a halt if she were ever elected. She'll be in court for her entire tenure and she'll be convicted. Because look, the first time--I mean, frankly, forget about this time. The first time she gets a subpoena from the United States Congress and she deletes everything? There shouldn't have been a second time.\n\nBut I have respect that the FBI has given it a second chance. And this time, I have no doubt that in that 650,000 e-mails--did you see where they said, oh, we're not worried. They're duplicates. How can there be duplicates if there are hundreds of thousands more than you started off with? \n\nSo today, I guess WikiLeaks, it sounds like, is going to be dropping some more, and if we met tomorrow, I'll tell you about it tomorrow, but one beauty that's been caught was, and this was just recently, newly released, where they say having a dump. We're having a dump of all of those e-mails.\n\nIn another communication, Bill Clinton's chief of staff says foreign government--right, this should be another one. Just like swamp--you know the swamp little statement--this one, this one. Do you remember what it is? Right? All the money is in, right? They said all the money is in. They're talking about foreign money pouring into their pockets. They said all the money is in. \n\nThis is what is running for office. Honestly, she should be ashamed of herself. She should be ashamed of herself.\n\nMy contract with the American voter begins with a plan to restore honesty to our government. That includes a ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections. Makes sense. I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and to heed the words we all will be saying right now. When we win on November 8th, we are going to Washington, D.C. and we are going to drain the swamp. \n\nGonna drain the swamp. We're gonna drain the swamp, folks. We're gonna drain that swamp. \n\nAnother important issue for Americans is integrity in journalism. These people are among the most dishonest people I've ever met, spoken to, done business with. These are the most dishonest people. \n\nThere has never been dishonesty--there has never been dishonesty like we've seen in this election. There's never been anywhere near the media dishonesty like we've seen in this election. Don't worry, they won't spin the cameras and show the kind of massive crowds. They won't do that. \n\nThe very talented Michael Goodwin of the New York Post just wrote today that 2016 presidential race will mark the low-water mark of journalism that is worthy--think of it--of the First Amendment. Never before have so many media organizations, old and new, abandoned all pretense of fairness to take sides and try to pick a president. \n\nIt's unbelievable. It's un-honest.\n\nFor instance, we have a great story. We give it out to the media. They'll make it look as bad as possible--as bad as possible. Parenthetically\n\nSo sad. Parenthetically and very sadly, earnings for the New York Times are down 97 percent this year. They just announced that. So bad. I feel so badly for them. Just announced--97 percent. Oh, they're doing great. And then they tell you who to vote for, you know? Who to vote for. They want crooked Hillary.\n\nThis isn't about me; it's about all of you and our magnificent movement to make America great again all over this country. And they're talking about it all over the world.\n\nAt the core of my contract is my plan to bring back jobs. \n\nRight now, 70 million American women and children live in poverty or near the brink of poverty. Forty-three percent of African- American school-aged children live in poverty. Thirty-two percent of Hispanic school-aged children live in poverty.\n\nThis is America, this is the United States, this is unacceptable. As your president, I will go into the poorest communities and work on a national plan for revitalization. \n\nWe will replace decades of failure with generations of success. Florida has lost one in four of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary. \n\nAnd here's a number that you should remember because it's not even a believable number, and it's correct. America has lost 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization. Another Bill and Hillary-backed disaster.\n\nWe are living through the greatest jobs left in the history of the world. Our jobs are going to Mexico, our jobs are going to other countries. China and others are making our product. We don't make it anymore. A Trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving America and we will stop the jobs from leaving Florida. \n\nMy second home, you know that, I'm here all the time. My second home, great place.\n\nThe theft of American prosperity will end. So they are stealing our prosperity, horribly stealing our prosperity. A Trump administration will renegotiate NAFTA and we'll stand up to foreign product dumping all over the place. \n\nCurrency manipulation by China and many other countries and all of the unfair subsidy behavior that's going on all over the world against us. We will also immediately stop the job-killing, Trans- Pacific Partnership, a disaster. \n\nAnd Hillary wants it to happen, she called it the gold standard, then she rejected it. But she's going to approve it. Then she lied during the debate, right? She lied. \n\nShe lied during the debate. She said she never called it the gold standard, she lied. And she lied about the line in the sand, right? She lied. As part of our plan to bring back jobs, we're going to lower taxes on American business from 35 percent to 15 percent. \n\nWe will also cancel billions in global warming payments to the United Nations \n\nand use that money to support America's vital environmental infrastructure and natural resources. We're spending hundreds of billions of dollars. We don't even know who's doing what with the money. We're gonna spend the money here. We're gonna work on our own environment. \n\nThat includes repairing the Herbert Hoover Dike at Lake Okeechobee and protecting the Florida Everglades. \n\nWe will become a rich nation again, but to be a rich nation, we must also be a safe nation \n\nA terrible tragedy today has occurred in Iowa. You read, you saw. Early this morning, two Iowa police officers, outstanding, outstanding people, were murdered, ambushed, ambushed violently while sitting in their squad cars. We send our thoughts and prayers to the family of the fallen. I just left Iowa, most beautiful place. The treatment was so incredible, the crowds, the police officers were so incredible the job they did. Now two of them are dead. An attack on our police is an attack on all of us. \n\nLaw enforcement is the line separating civilization from total chaos, you have to remember that. \n\nAccording to the national law enforcement officers, Memorial Fund, firearm related police were up 48 percent this year, the highest they've ever been. And there have been 14 ambush style attacks this year alone, never had anything like this.\n\nAnd what it is, is a lack of respect for our nation, it's a lack of respect for our leadership. To all the great men and women of law enforcement I want you to know, we're with you, we support you and we will stand by you. \n\nWe will restore law order and justice in America--justice. \n\nThank you. Thank you, so good luck to the people of Iowa.\n\nWe will also work with our federal and local law enforcements to keep America safe from terrorism. \n\nHillary Clinton wants a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees pouring into our countries. \n\nHer plan would mean generations of terrorism and extremism spreading in your schools and all throughout your communities. When I'm president, we will suspend the Syrian refugee program\n\nand we will keep radical Islamic terrorist the hell out of your community. \n\nNow, we all have heart and we're gonna build safe zones and we're gonna have some of the Gulf States that have nothing but money, they'll put up the money, we'll lead it, we'll build safe zones.\n\nBut we have enough problems in our country. She wants to increase the thousands and thousands that are pouring in right now. She wants to increase that number by 550 percent.\n\nAnd then, you wonder why Podesta says, she has bad instincts and you wonder why Bernie Sanders says, she's got bad judgment, they're right. She's got bad judgment, personally I think she's a very unstable person, if you wanna really know the truth. \n\nAnd we're gonna repeal and replace Obamacare, but you wanna know something? Honestly, I think for herself she's got much bigger problems right now than Obamacare. She's got bigger problems. \n\nLet's see what's on all those e-mails that they just found, see what's on those e-mails.\n\nThank you.\n\nIt's too bad those cameras aren't turning around to see this incredible group of people with thousands more outside, isn't it too bad? \n\nThey don't do it. But you know, if Hillary speaks and there's 30 people in the line they say, the crowd is massive. \n\nShe's never had a crowd like this in her life. \n\nPresident Obama shouldn't be campaigning for any longer, it's really a conflict, right? He oughta be working on jobs, on the border, on building up our military instead of campaigning for crooked Hillary Clinton, is what he oughta be doing. \n\nHe's in North Carolina, but we're going to North Carolina right after this, so. \n\nBut we have a few more today in Florida, and we have massive crowds. There's something happening. They're not reporting it. Katie, you're not reporting it, Katie. \n\nBut there's something happening, Katie. There's something happening, Katie. A Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. And yes, we will build the wall. \n\nThank you. \n\nWe've received the first ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers. First time they've ever endorsed a presidential candidate. \n\nThey tell us the border crisis taking place right now is the worst it's ever been. Now, in all fairness, people probably figure that I'm going to win. \n\nSo, they're racing across the border. I don't know. I'm sorry to do this to you, folks. \n\nHillary has pledged totally open borders, meaning you don't have a country anymore. And she strongly supports sanctuary cities like in San Francisco where\n\nRight? Where Kate Steinle was killed by a five time deported illegal immigrant. \n\nThe immigration officers warn that Hillary's plan is the most radical immigration proposal in U.S. history and that it will lead to the loss of thousands of lives. And I believe that. As secretary of State, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of the most dangerous and violent criminal aliens to go free because their countries would not take them back. \n\nCountless innocent Americans have been killed by illegal immigrants. Last year, as an example, 17-year-old Starlett Pitts, her boyfriend and her mother were stabbed to death in their Lee High Acres home by an illegal immigrant. The killer had been convicted of assaulting a police officer and was wanted for double murder and robbery. And the people that knew him were begging that he be incarcerated. They were begging. He was released from custody pending his court appearance, enabling him to commit murder.\n\nA Trump administration will stop illegal immigration, deport all criminal aliens and save American lives. \n\nAnd I want to thank, by the way, I see all these signs--\"Cubans for Trump.\" Cubans. I love Cubans. \n\nSo they gave me last week the Bay of Pigs Association, right? You know. They gave me their award last week and it was a great honor. And we're gonna fight very hard for the Cubans and we're gonna fight very, very hard for the Hispanics because they have not been properly taken care of.\n\nWhat's happened with the Hispanic population in our country is not right. What's happened with the inner cities of our country, the African-American community, the Hispanic community, is very, very unfair. \n\nThank you. Thank you.\n\nWe're going to take care of it. The crime is horrible, the education is terrible, and you can't get a job. We're going to fix the inner cities--we're going to fix the inner cities.\n\nThank you, fellows, that's so good. Blacks for Trump. That's so nice.\n\nWe will also repeal the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military. \n\nThat includes total support for homestead air reserve base. A Trump administration will stand in solidarity with the suffering people of Cuba and Venezuela all surrounding Dural--all surrounding Dural against the oppression of the Castro and Maduro regimes, you know what I'm talking about.\n\nWe will cancel Obama's one-sided Cuban deal made by Executive Order. If we do not get the deal we want, and the deal that people living in Cuba and here deserve\n\nincluding protecting religious and political freedom, right? I'm honored to have the endorsement of over 200 top admirals and generals, and 22 Medal of Honor recipients. \n\nYou know it's really called peace through strength. Peace through strength, that's what we're going to have, well, hopefully. Have to get rid of ISIS--we're going to get rid of ISIS, don't worry, we're getting rid of ISIS. But we have to get to rebuild our country.\n\nWe've spent six trillion dollars in the Middle East--six trillion dollars. And it's in far worse shape, by a factor of 10, from when we started. Six trillion--we lost lives, the most incredible, great people.\n\nOur new foreign policy will put America first. Hillary brought disaster to Iraq and Syria and Libya. And she empowered Iran, remember, she's got bad judgment. And she unleashed ISIS, came right out of the vacuum. Now she wants to start a shooting war in Syria in conflict with nuclear-armed Russia. Frankly, it could lead to World War III and she has no sense. She's got no instinct, but that's decided\n\nHillary and our failed Washington establishment, they've spent that six trillion dollars. I mean, I'd love to have that money back, but I'd much rather have all those lives back--rather have all those lives. \n\nLove to have those lives back. But the Middle East is in bad shape folks, and it's getting worse, totally getting worse. They've dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe. They've left our borders wide open at home and they've shipped our jobs and wealth to other countries. And these are foreign wars that we don't win--we don't win. We don't win anymore, we don't win with trade, we don't win with wars, we don't win anymore. We're going to start winning again, you watch. We're going to start. \n\nTo all Americans I say it's time for new leadership. Just think about what can be accomplished in the first 100 days of a Trump administration. We're going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan. \n\nAnd she is going to raise your taxes very substantially, I think you know that. \n\nWe will eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation, cancel every illegal Obama executive order, rebuild our military and take care of our great veterans. \n\nProvide school choice and put an end to Common Core; we're bringing our education local. \n\nSupport the men and women of law enforcement. \n\nWe're going to save our Second Amendment, which is under siege \n\nand appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. \n\nClinton wants us to think small, wants us to believe things can't change and wants our lives to revolve around Washington. I wonder if she's going to be there much longer. What do you think? \n\nI don't think so. I don't know. I'm not sure she's going to be there. But she wants--she wants our lives to revolve around Washington, D.C. I'm asking you to dream big, to push for bold change and to believe in a movement powered by the people and by their love for this great country. \n\nI'm tired of politicians telling Americans to defer their dreams to another day when they really mean another decade. America is tired of waiting. The moment is now. All we have to do is stop believing in our failed politicians and start believing in each other and in our country. \n\nThere is no challenge too great, no dream outside of our reach. Don't let anyone tell you it can't be done. The future lies with the dreamers, not the cynics, not the critics, certainly not the media. \n\nHillary has been there for 30 years and she has accomplished nothing. She's just made things worse. Look at her record. She's the candidate of yesterday; we are the--right? Is that right?\n\nWe are the movement of the future. Our movement represents all Americans from all backgrounds and all walks of life. We are asking for the votes of Republicans and Democrats and independents and first time voters. And believe me, there are a lot of first time voters that are standing on line right now. \n\nWe're asking for the vote of every American who believes truth and justice, not money and power, should rule the day. And I understand the other side very well. I've been there for a long time, but I love our country and I understand what has to be done. We are going in the wrong direction, and if we keep going in this direction, we won't have a country any longer. \n\nWe're fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people, not the donors and not the special interests. We're fighting to unlock the potential of every American community and every American family who hope and pray and yearn for a better future.\n\nWith your vote, we are just--think of it--six days away. \n\nThis started on June 16th of last year. It's a long time. Seems like a long time ago. But we're six days away from the change you've been waiting for your entire life. It'll never happen again. It'll never, ever happen. It's not going to happen in four years. When I see Cubans for Trump, it'll never happen again. I'm telling you. This whole thing will never happen again.\n\nThere's never been a movement like this in the history of our country--there's never been a movement like this.\n\nThank you. Thank you.\n\nThere has never been a movement like this in the history of our country--it's never happened. Even the pundits, even the ones that truly dislike Donald Trump have said, it's the single greatest phenomena the have ever seen. We have to close the deal. We have to close--get out and vote. November 8th fine, better if you vote now.\n\nMaybe you don't feel good November 8th, you don't want to get outta bed, you gotta get up, you gotta vote.\n\nTogether we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. \n\nThank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you. \n\nGet out and vote. God bless you, everybody. Thank you.\u0000","8":"This is the day the Lord has made. Let us rejoice and be glad in it!\nI am so  the world outside challenged the faith that comes from belief. In here, in this magnificent house of worship, we pray for peace when there is too much violence outside of these walls. In here, we are called to confront injustice, even when the world out there fails to see it. In here, we see the world as it is, but we pray for the strength and wisdom to build the world as it should be.\n\nIt has been 12 days since Mr. Scott was shot and killed. Twelve days since his wife Rakeiya Scott watched her husband die, and seven children lost their father. Now we don't yet know all the details about the shooting, but we do know this family and this community is in pain. And therefore we pray for them and we pray for all families who have suffered similar losses. But we do more than pray. As Ms. Bradford said, 'We do what each of us can do.' Not everyone can march, but everyone can talk, and everyone can reach out and everyone can vote.\n\nToo many African American families have been in the same tragic situation that the Scott family has found themselves. In fact, the day before Mr. Scott died, another father, Terence Crutcher, was killed in a police encounter in Tulsa, Oklahoma. And there have been many others. So many fathers and sons and even mothers and daughters who have died either after encounters with the police or at the hands of civilians with guns while they were doing things that were ordinary, everyday activities. Walking home from the store with iced tea and Skittles, listening to music in their car with friends.\n\nAnd we also know -- and we must not forget -- that violence has touched the families of police officers. Men and women who put on the uniform and put their lives on the line to protect others. From Dallas to Baton Rouge to Philadelphia, the families of fallen officers have also been dealt a great blow and they deserve our prayers as well.\n\nIt's been a hard year, hasn't it? Think about how many times President Obama has had to console our nation about another senseless tragedy, another shattered family, another distressed community. And our children are watching, and they feel it too. You've seen that right here in Charlotte. Last Monday at the city council meeting, 10-year-old Taje Gaddy said, 'I wake up every morning scared that I won't get to grow up because I am black.'\n\nA nine-year-old, Zianna Oliphant, who's here with us today, along with her brother Marquis and her family, also spoke at that city council meeting, with tears pouring down her face. And when I read what she had said, I had tears in my eyes too. She said, 'We are black people and we shouldn't have to feel like this. It's a shame that our fathers and mothers are killed, and we can't even see them anymore. It's a shame that we have to go to their graveyard and bury them. We need our fathers and mothers to be by our side.' What courage and clarity that young lady showed to the world.\n\nBut can you imagine, nine years old. She should be thinking about happy adventures, dreaming about all the wonderful things her future holds for her. Instead she's talking about graveyards. Our entire country should take a moment to really look at what's going on here, and across America, to imagine what we see on the news, and what we hear about, imagine through our children's eyes.\n\nI'm a grandmother, and like every grandmother I worry about the safety and security of my grandchildren, but my worries are not the same as black grandmothers. They have different, and deeper fears about the world that their grandchildren face. It makes my heart ache, when kids like Zianna, are going through this and trying to make sense of the absolutely senseless. I know how I would feel. I wouldn't be able to stand it if my grandchildren had to be scared and worried the way too many children across our country feel right now. But because my grandchildren are white, because they are the grandchildren of a former president and secretary of state, let's be honest here - they won't face the kind of fear that we heard from the young children testifying before the city council.\n\nYou know, every child deserves the same sense of security, every child deserves the same hope. They should not be facing fear, they should be learning and growing, imagining who they can be, and what their contributions to our country could be as well. We've got to take action, we've got to start now, not tomorrow, not next year, now. We know we can't solve all these problems over night, which means we don't have a moment to lose.\n\nProverbs tells us, 'Where there is no vision, the people perish.' So let's hold on to a common vision. Let's come together to make America a place where every child, no matter who they are, where they're born or what they look like, has the chance to live up to their God-given potential.\n\nBeing stronger together with this common vision means rejecting those forces that try to pit us against each other. We can acknowledge that implicit bias still exists, not just in police departments but throughout our country, without vilifying police officers. We can call for reforms to policing, while still appreciating the many courageous and admirable officers out there who are doing their jobs with honor and integrity.\n\nI think about an officer named Montrell Jackson. You might not have heard of him, but I want you to. He was one of the officers murdered in Baton Rouge. A few days before he died, he wrote on Facebook, he was black but he wore blue. 'In uniform,' he wrote, 'I get nasty, hateful looks. Out of uniform, some consider me a threat. These are trying times. Please don't let hate infect your heart.' And then he closed by saying that if anyone saw him on patrol and wanted a hug, 'I got you.'\n\nMontrell Jackson knew that making our communities safer and juster are not conflicting ideas. And most officers will tell you they can't do one without the other. I believe we need end-to-end reform in our criminal justice system, not half measures but full measures, with real follow-through. In America everyone should be respected by the law and have respect for the law.\n\nThat starts with being honest. Being unafraid to face the facts. Face the fact that black men are far more likely to be stopped, searched by police, charged with crimes and sentenced to longer prison terms than white men for doing the same thing. We need to fix a system where too many black parents are taken from their kids and imprisoned for minor offenses. We need to make sure our police officers are trained in de-escalating tense situations. We need to dismantle the so-called school-to-prison pipeline, and instead invest in education from early childhood through high school into higher education. And yes we have got to fight for common sense reforms to stop the epidemic of gun violence in our communities.\n\nGun violence is by far the leading cause of death for young black men, more than the next nine causes combined. We've got to make sure there are good jobs, equality affordable housing in every zip code in America. We need to make investments in communities that have been left out and left behind. I am a strong supporter of Congressman Jim Clyburn's plan to put 10 percent of our federal funds into 20 percent of the communities that have generational poverty for 30 years or more.\n\nNow, there are some out there who see this as a moment to command the flames of resentment and division. Who want to exploit people's fears, even though it means tearing our nation even further apart. They say that all of our problems will be solved simply by more 'law and order.' As if the systemic racism plaguing our country doesn't exist. Now, of course we need safe neighborhoods, no one is against that. Of course, we need communities that are free from the epidemic of gun violence, of course we need that. But we also need justice and dignity and equality, and we can have both. This is not an either-or question for America.\n\nI want us to commit ourselves to this common vision. That is where I will build on the work that President Obama has done. And I will be sure that this is not just about a campaign or an election. This is much bigger than an election. These are issues I've been fighting for since I was a young lawyer working for the Children's Defense Fund. Going to South Carolina to try to get young teenagers, 13, 14-year-olds out of jails with adult offenders. I care deeply about this because it's not just personal to so many of us, it's about the kind of country you want to be and the future we want for all of our children and grandchildren. I think about that every time I see my grandchildren or every time I see a bright, energetic, impressive young woman like Zianna. Come up here a minute, would you?\n\nI love your dress.\n\nYou know, God loves us all, right? We are called to care for and cherish each other. It's not easy, it is not. But that is our mission and that is what we are called to do, not only as Christians but as Americans, as human beings to understand and respect each other. To fight for each other's children, each other's dignity, each other's opportunity as if they were our own. Now, make no mistake, this is not easy work. You've been doing this since Adam and Eve came here. But it is righteous work. Protecting all of God's children is America's calling. Remember what scripture also tells us: 'Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.' We will not grow weary and we will not lose heart. We will get up every single day have faith in one another and in our future and work for that better day for all of God's people. Thank you.\u0000","9":"Thank you everybody. This is a big, big crowd, you know? \nI'll tell you the same thing, however, the only people that will be shown on television won't be the 15,000 people, it'll be this group right over here. \n\nSo, the good news is, you have better seats, or standing room only, but you have better, but they're going to be more famous, right? They're going to be more famous. \n\nLook, we want to have the cameras circle around and show this crowd, will you do that cameras? \n\nGo ahead cameras. \n\nThey never do it. They never do it, so we won't waste our time, it's just the dishonest media. Look. \n\nWe love being here, I love being with you. I love this state, as you know, I'm here all the time. \n\nIn 27 days, we're going to win Florida \n\nand we're going to win back the White House. \n\nAnd that's what's happening folks, that's what's happening. \n\nWe're going to bring back our jobs, we're going to end illegal immigration, we're going to renegotiate our totally disastrous I mean these deals, aye yai yai the trade deals the worst. We're going to renegotiate those trade deals, reduce surging crime. You saw what happened the other day, murders in the United States, the highest level in 45 years. You don't hear that from the press. \n\nWe're going to cut taxes big league. Crooked Hillary is going to raise taxes. We're going to cut taxes and regulations. We're going to reduce the costs of education. By the way, we're going end the Common Core, and we're bringing our education local. \n\nWe're going to lift the restrictions on American Energy and deliver real change for our great American people; it's time. \n\nAnd when it comes to international government, to massive trade deals, and to America's borders, we're going to defend the freedom and sovereignty of the United States of America like never before. \n\nAnd we are going to once again put America first. \n\nThe deadline for voter register who is not registered? Is there anybody in here not registered? If you're not registered, get the hell out of here, OK? \n\nThere's a nice looking young guy hey listen, leave right now and go and register. \n\nThey just extended it for a little while, so right after you, raise your right hand. Do you promise you're going to register after this? If you like what I say, OK, if you like what I say. \n\nSeriously, I'm curious, who is not registered in this room? OK, all young people. Believe me, the young people like me better than Bernie, I'm telling you. \n\nBecause with me, when you graduate from college, you're going to come out and you're going to have a vast array of jobs. OK, right? \n\nSo go out and register, and we're going to have an awfully big I'll tell you what, honestly, we're going to have a big four years, eight years, we're going to have a big, great future for our country. \n\nAlso, you can request an absentee ballot and you can vote by mail, if necessary. So, register, request a ballot.\n\nThank you. I love you. I love you, too.\n\nThe Hillary Clinton documents have you been seeing this, what's going on? Released by WikiLeaks make more clear than ever just how much is at stake in November and how unattractive and dishonest our country has become.\n\nThe election of Hillary Clinton would lead, in my opinion, to the almost total destruction of our country as we know it. She would be the most dishonest and the most corrupt person ever elected to high office. And I don't think it would be close.\n\nThe WikiLeaks e-mails show the Department of Justice fed information, did you see this? to the Clinton campaign.\n\nSo think of this. The Department of Justice, you remember that whole deal with Wild Bill getting on the back of an airplane, just happened to be in Arizona.\n\nHe was gonna play golf. It was 110 degrees.\n\nBut he gets on the back of the airplane to meet with the Attorney General to talk about his golf game and to talk about his grandkids. He was there for 39 minutes. \n\nI think most of us know what happened. \n\nSo fed information, Department of Justice fed information think of this to the Clinton campaign about the e-mail investigation so that the campaign could be prepared to cover up her crimes. Now, did you ever hear \n\nDid you ever hear anything like this? \n\nAnd, and by the way, these dishonest people, mainstream media, they don't talk about this. They don't talk about this. Now, if I sneeze if Donald Trump sneezes today, it's a major story. \n\nHere you have Department of Justice coming to see them to brief them prior to their interview. Folks, this is out of control.\n\nAnd the FBI unbelievable people. You have incredible people in the FBI. I would be willing to be that they are so ashamed of what's happened at the upper level.\n\nI would be willing to bet that they don't even sleep at night.\n\nThese are great people. These are great Americans. And they can't believe what's going on.\n\nThis corruption and collision is just one more reason why I will ask my Attorney General to appoint a special prosecutor. \n\nOur country has never been so low. In addition to a special prosecutor to look into what happened and all of the corruption, and all of the we'll say so called crime.\n\nBut look, when somebody deletes 33,000 e-mails after getting a subpoena. But we have to also remember this remember this. This is maybe in a sense even more important.\n\nWe have to investigate the investigation. \n\nWe have to investigate the investigation. \n\nWe've never had a case like this. And even Congress, you know, is sort of they've never had this before, because there's no event like this that ever took place.\n\nNormally, Congress you know she lied to Congress. She lied to the FBI. And remember, he said she was negligent. She was all the things you needed to be, but she lied to Congress, she lied to the FBI, she lied to everybody she even lied in the debates about the gold standard, right.\n\nRemember, she said, I never said gold standard. And remember when I said line in the sand? She said, I wasn't secretary of state. I said, I think you were, but let's see even the press said she was secretary of state, so she lied about that.\n\nBut think of this. Think of this. There's never been a time like this in our country. And Congress, in all fairness and I'm so disappointed in them. I am so disappointed in Congress. I am so disappointed. \n\nAnd I mean both sides. I'm not talking Republican Dem I'm talking everybody. To allow a thing like this to go this is crime at the highest level. She shouldn't be allowed to run for president. You know that. \n\nOther people's lives have been ruined, destroyed, for doing a tiny fraction of what she did. You saw the man with the book, he had to give back all the royalties and went through hell. You saw the man with the picture of the submarine, his mother goes around, she's devastated, devastated. Took pictures of a submarine. And you take a look at this.\n\nSo we have to investigate the investigation, and Congress but I speak to Congressmen. They don't know what to do. Because normally, they vote and they hand it over to the FBI and the Justice Department. But the FBI and the Justice Department won't do anything, so they don't know what to do. \n\nNow, they do make laws. Maybe they have to make up a law for a case like this. But they take these criminal acts, in my opinion, criminal acts, hand them over to the FBI, the FBI actually acknowledge that even, frankly, could have gone that speech could have been 10 times longer.\n\nBut all of these things yes, she did this, yes, she did this, yes, she did that, yes, she did that, but we're not going to do anything, right but what do you do when you hand them over to the FBI and the Justice Department and that's the end of it? We have never been in a position like this.\n\nI'm so embarrassed by what's taken place, and I'm very, very disappointed in Congress because our people, our politicians I don't know, do they make a deal where everybody protects each other in Washington? Maybe that's it. I really believe it. I really believe it. I almost say, listen, we're going to leave you alone, but when it's our turn, you have to leave them alone. Do they make deals like this?\n\nThis is the most heinous, the most serious thing that I've ever seen involving justice in the United States in the history of the United States. We have a person that has committed crimes that is now running for the presidency, and she has the Justice Department, where she essentially told the AG in the speech or a talk that she'd appoint her AG again. And this is the person that's supposed to be ruling?\n\nFolks, whether I win, lose, or draw, I'm ashamed of what's happened to our country and so are you. \n\nHillary Clinton bleached and deleted 33,000 e-mails. And did you see, two days ago, boxes of e-mails and other things were missing? They were missing.\n\nSo she deleted 33,000 e-mails and bleached them. By the way, nobody bleaches; nobody I have people that are sophisticated in this world. They never even heard of it. They called it acid wash, meaning you can never retrieve them, although I have a feeling that the NSA has them. They don't want them. They don't want to get them. I have a feeling. \n\nSo then she did this after, not before. Before would be bad. She did this after getting a congressional subpoena.\n\nNow, if your friend is suing you in a regular lawsuit, and you do that, you go to jail. Here's the United States Congress subpoenas her e-mails and other things, and she deletes the e-mails, saying there are 33,000 e-mails remember? for the wedding and for yoga classes 33,000 e-mails. \n\nAnd then and then after all of that, now they're missing two boxes of perhaps the most important of the group.\n\nAnd what about her law firm? You know what? She's using a phenomenal law firm. I know the firm. Phenomenal law firm. They're the ones that did all this stuff. Remember, they said we made a ruling they were work-related. You can't do that. If they're work- related, what you do is you show them you show them and you get them. It's a law firm nobody ever mentions. The law firm is unbelievable. It's very powerful. OK?\n\nObviously, they've done a great job. But that law firm should be implicated in this crime. OK? \n\nThey're the ones they got rid of all this stuff. The law firm got rid of all this stuff. And they should be implicated because they have committed a crime. They are not supposed to say, \"Oh, we got rid of most of it.\" That law firm that I know very well, as I said total professionals, total insiders they got rid of 33,000 and much more than that. It is one of the great miscarriages of justice.\n\nSo then she destroyed her phones, some with a hammer, to cover up her crimes. Now, how many of you people have gotten rid of cell phones and you start whacking them with a hammer? Has any please raise your hand? Please. One. What business are you in?\n\nI see two hands. We have 15,000. Two hands. Anybody else? It is so disgraceful. It's so embarrassing. And by the way, we're going to go over some of the WikiLeaks stuff. The press hardly reports it. They hardly report it. She did a big number of Catholics, horrible number on Catholics. She did a horrible number on evangelicals through her people.\n\nAnd they hardly report it. While she was secretary of state, she lost or disappeared almost $6 billion. Does anyone know that? No. How do you lose $6 billion? Even Chelsea Clinton in the WikiLeaks emails expressed, quote, \"serious concerns about conflicts of interest at the Clinton Foundation and the State Department.\"\n\nAmericans have had it with the years and decades of Clinton corruption. It's corruption Whitewater, cattle. \n\nNever is with these people. Remember years ago most of you are too young to remember. Remember the cattle? She bought some cattle and she had the greatest return, like almost in the history of cattle deals? And some of these professional cattlemen and cattle women they say, boy, she's really good at this stuff. They'd been doing it all their lives, they had never had a return like that. It's corruption, folks. It's corruption.\n\nThey understood that, by the way. They're smart, they got it very quickly.\n\nThis will finally be the year the American people say, enough is enough. During a recent trip to Florida, I had a chance to spend some time with the incredible residents of Little Haiti, and you see what's going on in Haiti, it's a horrible thing. And you see what's going on with Clinton, it's a horrible thing. These are not fans of Clinton. That, I can tell you.\n\nThey despise the Clintons for what they did to the Haitian people. New e-mails revealed by ABC News just yesterday show that during the deadly earthquake in Haiti, which killed over 150,000 people, the Clintons couldn't stop cashing in. They kept cashing in.\n\nAs people were dying in Haiti, Clinton insiders were separating out requests from friends of Bill or William Jefferson Clinton VIPs so that their business interests or contracts would receive very special treatment, while those who were not special friends would be put permanently on the sidelines.\n\nAnd remember this. Hillary's brother, running a gold mine, put on the gold Tony, you saw Tony. Tony. Anybody want to hire Tony? He's put on the board of a big gold mine company, having to do with Haiti. It's so bad.\n\nLook, we're in a rigged system, folks. This is a rigged, rigged system. You saw so many of the things. I'll tell you, this WikiLeaks stuff is unbelievable. It tells you the inner heart you got to read it. And you got to maybe get it, because they're not putting it out. They want to put it out, but they can't do that, because without the media and without the press, Hillary Clinton would be nothing. She'd be nothing. Zero. \n\nAnd by the way, did everybody see the debate the other day, yes? \n\nSo they had nine online polls. Some of them had us 90 to 10, 80 to 20. \"Time Magazine\" had like a massive look, \"Time Magazine\" is no friend of mine except they put me on the cover so much. Not because they like me, because they like selling magazines.\n\nBut \"Time Magazine\" it was total destruction. And then the next morning, she walks in and says, did everybody see the debate? People go, yes, yes. Did we beat her or what? I look so forward\n\nI do. I look so forward to the next one in Las Vegas.\n\nAs Haiti's death toll from Hurricane Matthew is on the rise, we should never forget how Bill and Hillary Clinton handled Haiti the last time. To all our friends in Little Haiti they're great people. I mean, I spent a long time these are people that are incredible. They have the warmest feeling, the warmest heart. But to all of our friends in Little Haiti, your day of justice is coming, believe me. \n\nAnd it arrives on November 8. November 8, get out and vote.\n\nThe new e-mails also show members of the Clinton team viciously attacking Catholics and Evangelicals. They attacked Catholics and evangelicals. \n\nViciously. \n\nAnd that won't be tolerated but it won't be tolerated by the voters. Tell you what anybody of religion I really think you have to vote for Donald Trump to be honest with you. I really do believe it. \n\nAnd in all of the primaries you saw that. I wasn't expected to win with evangelicals but once we got started and once they heard my message as opposed to other people's messages we really we won big with evangelicals. They're incredible people. \n\nRemember the Johnson Amendment. We're gonna get rid of that Johnson Amendment. Just remember that. \n\nThese emails are just the latest evidence of the hatred that the Clinton campaign has for everyday faithful Americans. True. The Wikileaks email show that Hillary Clinton's staff, even has to give her secret notes on when she needs to smile. Smile Hillary. Smile. \n\nHey folks, we have to get back to work. Our country's in trouble. We can't play games anymore. Smile. You believe it? Smile. \n\nAnd how about where it said to the public you say this, but to the others that give you the money you say that. I'll tell you. It's so revealing somebody's going to do a great book on that, because the press just did not little tiny stories, big, big things. Getting answers for debates and questions for debates, before the debate takes place. How about that?\n\nI'll tell you what. Can you imagine me, if any of this stuff pertained to me? Front page headlines all over the world, Donald Trump oh well, we've been there and we seem to be doing really well.\n\nHillary Clinton, commonly referred to as Crooked Hillary, thinks that you all of you are deplorable and totally irredeemable. \n\nI actually think irredeemable is worse, I don't know. I'm the only one. Deplorable and irredeemable. Irredeemable meaning, meaning you can never, ever come back. I call you hard-working American patriots, and together we are going to save this country and we are going to make America great again. \n\nAnd it's hot as hell in here but I don't care. \n\nCall it Florida, right? Florida. \n\nEmails also show that the DNC vice-chair was feeding information so much information to the candidate. Oh man, I want that why can't the Republicans do that? Why can't Reince feed me information prior to a debate. I'm so angry at the Republicans I want to be fed information like Hillary gets. \n\nAnd we still beat her badly, right? So I mean what's the big deal? But I want information. The Republicans are not doing their job. They should be able to get me all of the questions prior to the debate.\n\nThis all comes after a secret tape that shows Hillary Clinton calling Bernie voters now look Bernie I feel sorry for Bernie.\n\nHe made a deal with the devil and he blew his reputation. But she called Bernie voters basement dwellers.\n\nSo all of the Bernie votes out there, join our movement, like all of these young people. We're going to fix our trade deals and get special interests out of government.\n\nAnd by the way, by the time this ends, I'll have over a hundred million dollars of my money in this thing, right, which means that's $100 million of people that don't have to give me money and say, Donald, will you do this, will you do that, will you do that? \n\nThat's a lot of money. \n\nAnd I asked her the other night, I said, you know, I will have over a hundred million and that's a lot of money. If I lose, I'm going to be so angry at Florida. \n\nI'll still love you, I think. Maybe not. \n\nYou know, one of the pundits said, and you've heard me say this maybe, but they said, Mr. Trump, it doesn't matter whether you win or lose. You have done the single greatest job. nobody's ever done a thing like this before. No matter where we go it's like this. But... \n\nThey said it's the single Bill O'Reilly said it, but many peoples said, it's the single greatest political phenomena they've ever seen. I said, wait a minute, you're wrong.\n\nIf I don't win on November 8th, I will consider this the single greatest waste of time, energy and money of anything I've ever done, because we're not going to be able to reduce your taxes, we're not going to be able to save your Second Amendment, appoint Supreme Court judges, take care of you vets, fix up your depleted, very depleted the greatest people on earth but our military is so depleted.\n\nWe're going to take care of a lot of things, including getting the drugs out. A vote for Hillary is a vote for more reckless foreign invasions. What a mess did she do does she go down as the all-time worst?\n\nMore Wall Street cheating, more terrible trade deals. And as WikiLeaks showed, she wants to cut your Medicare and Social Security benefits. You didn't see that. \n\nSee? And I'm not going to. The press doesn't report that she wants to cut your Social Security. And she wants to cut Medicare and one of the big advantages of me having a rather large microphone, meaning a lot of people are listening, is that I can talk about WikiLeaks and look it's on al the television networks live. We're live. \n\nAmazing. \n\nI think they are just turning them all off now. Watch. You go home, they'll say, why did it end so abruptly?\n\nA vote for Trump is a vote for America first and it's a vote to protect Medicare and Social Security and lower your taxes. \n\nBig, big tax decrease. We're going to lower your taxes. WikiLeaks also shows something I've been warning about for a very, very long time. The media is simply an extension of the Clinton Campaign. \n\nIt's one of the biggest ways that our system is rigged. And I was the first one to use that term when I was running in the primaries when I won Louisiana and I got fewer delegates than people that I beat easily.\n\nAnd my people said, oh no, that's the way the system I say, well then the system's wrong! How do you win a state and you get less delegates?\n\nAnd I said, this system is rigged! And it was, but we figured out how to win, right? That's what you need. \n\nWon in a landslide. I got more votes than anybody in the history of the Republican Party in the primaries system \n\nBy far. Wasn't even close. \n\nReporters who work for these outlets like the Washington Post or the New York Times may think of themselves as journalists, but they're actually cogs for a corrupt political machine. That's the Clinton machine. The e-mail show the New York Times, the Boston Globe, Univision who I sued I sued Univision, and I was very happy with what they did. \n\nAnd this lightweight, you know John Hardwood, this lightweight. This guy who came out, he was shaking. He was so nervous.\n\nHe asked me the first question, \"Mr. Trump, could you answer this question?\" What a lightweight. They shoulda fired him for what he did.\n\nJohn Harwood. I hate to make him famous but 'cause nobody ever heard of him before, but a total lightweight of CNBC all doing favors for the Clintons.\n\nAnd reporters smothering the Clintons with praise. The New York Times even gave Clinton a call to give her a veto power over her quotes in a story that was already written. Nobody ever called me and said, \"Hi, Mr. Trump. We wrote a story. Would you read the story and please give us a little feedback. Would you like us to take anything out?\"\n\nThis system is so rigged. Now, this is all down in the e-mails. She had veto power over what she said.\n\nI'll tell you what. I want to have that, too. I want to have veto power.\n\nI used to get such good publicity, folks. Now, I mean it's like it's incredible. I used to get my life was so simple.\n\nMy life was so simple. I had a beautiful, simple life. It was going.\n\nI built an unbelievable company. And then I decide to do this, and my life became slightly more complex.\n\nYou know, we have people in this audience right now that 18 years ago had one great job, they were making more money 18 years ago than they're making now. And now they have two and sometimes three jobs. In other words, they're older and they're working harder, and they're making less.\n\nNot a good not a good assemblage of facts. Here's the only good news. I'm also older and working harder than I've ever worked before.\n\nOK? That I can tell you. \n\nIncluding being in this wonderful area at 114 degrees temperature. \n\nWhich is great 'cause you go home and you lose weight. I mean why you can't be. You go home, you say, \"I feel great. I lost a lot of weight.\"\n\nBy the way, let Hillary Clinton stand up here for an hour and talk the way I talk, and let's see how long she lasts folks. \n\nOh, what a joke what a total joke. Our country's in such trouble. That's why I'm I it's just so ridiculous.\n\nThe corporate media can't report on the establishment because the corporate media is the establishment, such a big part of it. We're going to break up the special interest monopoly, and we're going to win this country back for the American people. We're gonna do it, too. \n\nThe e-mails also reveal that Hillary Clinton believes in global governments, unlimited immigration unlimited, much more than Obama. From the Middle East, come right in. Come right in.\n\n550 percent more than President Obama, who is grossly incompetent. He doesn't know what the hell he's doing. \n\nAnd why is he campaigning? We just had a horrible jobs report. We have no growth. You saw GDP at one percent we have no growth. We have a horrible jobs report. China is ripping us off. Japan is ripping us off with the cars. Mexico has a unbelievable deal with us, both on the border I mean, look at our trade deficit with Mexico. And China, and Vietnam, and everybody.\n\nLast year, our country had a trade deficit of almost $800 billion. $800 billion. \n\nWho the hell negotiates these deals? I mean, can you believe it? So I say, why the hell is Obama allowed to campaign for Hillary Clinton? He's always campaigning, and he's doing his little thing, you know, having a good time. He ought to be out in the White House. He's not there long. He ought to be there working and fixing some of these horrible trade deals and bringing jobs back to our country, not campaigning for a crooked person, for a totally dishonest and crooked person. \n\nSpeaking in secret to a foreign bank, Hillary Clinton said, my dream is a hemispheric common market that's not good for your jobs with totally open trade and open borders. 600 million people could pour into the United States. You'll have nothing left.\n\nTell you, if that happens, I know the real estate here, I love the real estate here sell fast. Behind closed doors, when she thought no one was listening, she pledged to dissolve the borders of the United States of America. This all came out. She said she wants to dissolve the borders. And here I am saying, we want strong borders. We don't want drugs coming in. We don't want crime coming in. I don't know, maybe I'm wasting my time. Am I wasting my time? I don't think so. \n\nShe doesn't want to have any borders. Total amnesty tell you what, folks. This is the last time you'll ever have a chance to save our country. It's not going to happen. You won't be able to. The numbers will be too great. Already, the Republican nominee has a massive disadvantage, and especially when you have the leaders not putting their weight behind the people. They're not putting their weight behind the people\n\nInstead of calling me and saying, congratulations, you did a great job. You absolutely destroyed her in the debate, like everybody said you know, Pat Buchanan wrote the big article today, you saw it--I'm not bragging, I'm just saying--maybe a little bit, but here--he said it was the single greatest debate performance in the history of presidential politics. \n\nSo wouldn't you think that Paul Ryan would call and say, good going? In front of just about the largest audience for a second night debate in the history of the country. So you know, you'd think that they'd say, great going, Don. Let's go, let's beat this crook. She's a crook. Let's beat her. We got to stop it. No, he doesn't do that.\n\nThere's a whole deal going on there. I mean, you know, there's a whole deal going on and we're going to figure it out. I always figure things out. But there's a whole sinister deal going on.\n\nCrooked Hillary wants to end forever the American independence that our founders gave us. Our great founders are spinning in their graves. Our founders are spinning in their graves like Douglas MacArthur, like George Patton, like our generals. They're spinning in their grave and by the way, General Flynn and all the generals - over 200 admirals and generals have endorsed Donald Trump.\n\nTwo hundred. Over 200. \n\nTwenty-one congressional Medal of Honor recipients have endorsed Donald Trump. I'll tell you, you know what I like? Very smart, tough people like me. I like that. The smart, tough people, they like Trump.\n\nAmerican soldiers have fought and died to win and keep America's freedom and now Hillary Clinton wants to surrender that freedom to open borders, open trade, and world government. And I do believe in free trade but I believe more in smart trade.\n\nWe're going to make great deals with other countries. We're going to bring jobs back. We're going to bring jobs back. \n\nI'm not running to be president of the world. I'm running to be president of the United States of America. \n\nOh, I wish those cameras would turn so some time our friends back in New York and back in Pennsylvania and back in Ohio and all these different states, they could see the crowds but they do hear it. You know, when you hear the noise, they say they never show the crowd but you hear the crowd. You can't imitate that noise. \n\nWe will never surrender the freedom and sovereignty of the United States. It's going to be America first, America first, America first. \n\nAnd yesterday, Hillary had Al Gore - climate change. Now, I want - just so you know - do you know that I've won numerous environmental awards? I'm a believer in the environment. It's got to be within reason. I'm a believer. Here's what I want, though. I want immaculately clean water and I want immaculately clean air. That's what I want. That's called climate change. That's called environmental protection \n\nBut Hillary had this deal. Very, very lightly attended and I watched on television as they said this is the largest crowd that she's had. You know what she's got? Like a tiny little fraction. Now, they're not going to say look at the crowd with crooked Hillary yesterday. She had Al Gore get up, this poor guy. \n\nI don't know what the hell happened to him. What happened to him? She had Al Gore get up, because don't forget, Obama thinks that climate change is the single biggest and most dangerous problem for the world today. \n\nNot nuclear weapons in the hands of maniacs or in the hands of countries that hate us. No, no that's no problem. Climate change is our problem. I'll tell you how this going, how we're doing folks. If we don't win this election, I don't know what I'm going to do. \n\nI don't know. No, no can you imagine? Here's a guy where we have ISIS that he essentially founded, if you look. Remember I said, founded and he's going to get the medal for having--and I kiddingly. But it's really not that kiddingly but then they put it on Mo Bisely, he found and I says, let me tell you something. When they pulled out of Iraq the way they--we should have never been in Iraq and I was against it and they know it.\n\nBut we should have never been in Iraq. But when we were, the way he pulled out, he announced when he's leaving, he pulled out everybody instead of leaving, groups behind. And they created a vacuum and ISIS was formed. Now think of this because the biggest thing that came out of the debate in my opinion, and it really came out of the first debate, which if I didn't have fixed microphone or a broken microphone, nobody's been able to tell me, but I watched.\n\nCouldn't talk very good because my mike didn't work. But I watched and I said you know, it's interesting. Hillary said she's going to do this and this and this but she's been there for 30 years, she never did it. \n\nAnd I said to her in the second debate, I said let me ask you a question. Let me--and by the way, you know that so-called Commission on Presidential Debates, the head guy used to work for Bill Clinton. Did you know that? I just found that out. The head guy worked for Bill Clinton. What a rigged deal this is. But here's the story. I have no respect for that group by the way, I have none. It sounds good. Presidential commission, give me a break. \n\nThat's why I was so happy what we did to annihilate the enemy the other day. So happy. \n\nBecause we're dealing against a very dishonest system. But Hillary, so important, wants to have a radical, and this is very radical, immigration. She wants to radicalize immigration where you have people pouring in. Remember this, the border patrol agents, 16,500 gave me their endorsement. Last week, ICE, ICE, these are great people, you don't hear great things because they're not allowed to do their job.\n\nThese are people that frankly, would work a lot less. I mean their job's easier if Hillary wins because basically all they have to do is stand there and watch people walk in front of them. ICE, these are great people. Tough people, smart people. First time in their history they endorse me, they've got to work harder, and they endorse me. \n\nAnd one of the things they told me that I thought was terrible is that she refused when she was secretary of state to make foreign countries take back their criminal aliens. In other words, we have somebody in from a foreign country illegally. The person kills somebody, hurts somebody, robs a store, robs a bank, does all sorts--sells drugs all over the place, poisons our youth. And we want to send them back to the country from which they came and they bring them back and the country says, we're not taking them.\n\nBecause they're smart. They don't want them. So they bring them back into the United States and put him into our society. I guarantee you, and you can mark my words, and there's a lot of tape running, that won't happen once when Donald Trump is president; not once, guarantee you that. \n\nOne convicted criminal alien, she allowed to go free--totally free; killed a young girl named Casey Chadwick; beautiful young girl. The corrupt establishment in Washington wants to surrender America's borders, even as they send our troops overseas to protect the borders of other countries. She'll protect those borders, but not our borders.\n\nCasey Chadwick was a great example, and he was let free, and she should be alive today. Jamiel Shaw has a son--had a son, a great young man, killed violently. And I don't know if you know, but killed violently by an illegal immigrant, shot three times in the face for no reason; somebody that wasn't supposed to be here.\n\nAnd you have--you have case after case after case. We're not going to have it anymore. We're not going to be the stupid people anymore. We're not going to be the stupid, weak people anymore. \n\nA Trump administration will secure, control, defend and protect the borders of the United States, as sure as you are standing here today. \n\nWe will 100 percent build the wall, 100 percent. \n\nAre you ready? Are you ready? \n\nAnd who is going to pay for the wall?\n\n \"Mexico\"\n\n100 percent. They just don't know it yet. They don't know it yet, but 100 percent. They'll pay for the wall.\n\nHey, look, we're going to have a great relationship with Mexico and China and all of these countries that are ripping us off and now have no respect. They're going to make less and they're going to like us more. Funny how that works, but it's true. Mexico is making a fortune with trade. They're taking our jobs. So many things. They are going to respect us finally.\n\nWe will stop the drugs from pouring into our country. Florida has seen a 470 percent increase in heroin deaths. Think of that--think if you have a child--470 percent increase in heroin deaths since 2007. Think of that. Think of your kids and your grandkids.\n\nWe're going to stop it. And most of it's coming across the southern border. And let me tell you, when we allow ICE and when we allow the Border Patrol agents and when we give them that big beautiful wall with a door in it so people can come in, but they have to come in legally; we want them to come in, but they have to come in legally. \n\nWe will stop the drugs from poisoning our youth and others. \n\nBut I have a message for the drug dealers, for the gang members and the criminal cartels: Your days are numbered, believe me; your days are numbered. \n\nHillary also wants a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees. We don't know anything about them. \n\nThis, even though she admitted in private according to WikiLeaks, just out, that she knows terrorists are trying to infiltrate--she knows it--they're trying to infiltrate our refugee program. So she said it just yesterday that she knows they're trying to come in through that method, and yet she wants 550 percent more than even Obama's staggeringly high numbers, thousands and thousands.\n\nWe can't let it happen. And we all have a heart, and we'll build safe havens and we'll have the Gulf States pay because they're not doing their share. Believe me, they're not. They have plenty of money, they'll pay. We can't pay. We owe $20 trillion. 20 trillion, doubled during Obama years. Doubled. He doubled the debt during his years.\n\nIn fact, the terrorists have already infiltrated our country. There are now 1,000 open ISIS investigations in our 50 states. A record. Attack after attack, including the recent terror strikes in New Jersey, New York, Minnesota, as well as the mall shooting in Washington, were made possible by our extremely open immigration system that's meant only to protect fools, and we're not fools. \n\nSo let me state this clearly as I can. I am going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. \n\nShe won't even use the word. She won't even use the term. Our incompetent president--I call him our campaign president--our incompetent president won't use the term radical Islamic terrorism. He won't use it. He tries to explain it. He spends hours trying to explain why. If you don't identify your problem, folks, you're never going to get rid of it. It's only getting worse.\n\nAnd remember, I said it before, we've started off when he became president with no ISIS. Nobody head the term ISIS, which he calls ISIL, right. You know why he does that? Because he likes disturbing all of you. He calls ISIL. But we started off, we had no ISIS. And now, 7 1\/2 years later, they're in, they think, 32 countries.\n\nAnd she's going to get rid of them? I can tell you this. They are hoping and they are praying--they are hoping and praying that Hillary Clinton becomes president of the United States, because they'll take over not only that part of the world. They'll take over this country, they'll take over this part of the world, believe me. They are hoping.\n\nAnd by the way, she likes to say, they want me--I will be their worst nightmare. I'm going to be their worst nightmare. \n\nAnd she lied during the debate. Remember when I said the red line in the sand, right? She said, I wasn't secretary of state then, all flustered, all crazy. She was there when they drew the line. I walked out, they said, you know, she was there. Oh, well, she sort of said she wasn't. She was there.\n\nIt turned out to be a lie. And even the media said that they hated - she lied about that. She lied about many things.\n\nShe put Iran on the path to nuclear weapons. You know, this horrible Iran deal where they gave $400 million in cash, but it turned out to be $1.7 billion in cash. You couldn't fit that in the back of this arena, that's how much money it is.\n\nShe gave - they gave that much money to the terrorists, to our enemies. And by the way, our enemies aren't even nice to us. Now they're emboldened.\n\nYou see the little boats going around our beautiful ships doing all sorts of little things to drive our people crazy. Folks, they're not gonna do that stuff when I'm president, I guarantee ya. \n\nYou see the way they captured our ten sailors 'cause they were a little bit in the wrong waters. And instead of saying nicely, \"Hey, listen. You gotta be over there a little bit\", they humiliated the sailors, humiliated their families, and humiliated our country, right.\n\nAnd the only reason they let 'em go is that our payments of $150 billion started the next day. So stupid they're not.\n\nAnd when they fly - they - they flew right alongside of our - our planes the other. You saw that? Their jet fighters.\n\nRight, you saw that? And when Putin is buzzing - you know Hillary's tough with Russia.\n\nYou ever notice anything that goes wrong, they blame Russia. Russia did it. They have no idea. We're being hacked because we have people that don't know what they're doing.\n\nThey have people. But they always blame Russia and then they say, \"Donald Trump is friends with Putin.\"\n\nI don't know Putin, folks. I promise. I don't know Putin.\n\nWhat the hell do I have to do with Putin? These people are professional con people. They're con.\n\nAnd this country can't have it. This country can't have it. And - and by the way, Russia, which is buzzing our ships, right.\n\nYou know, tough Hillary, tough Obama, they're buzzing. You saw that two weeks ago, buzzing, planes going by. They took over - yeah, they took over.\n\nYou look at Ukraine. They took over during - that was Crimea. They took that over during Obama's reign.\n\nYou know, tough Obama. He's so tough. He's so tough.\n\nSo, look, we need competence and we need it fast. Hillary Clinton who turned Libya into a nightmare.\n\nHow about Libya? How about Benghazi? How about - how about Benghazi where Ambassador Stevens sent 600 different messages to Hillary Clinton, and she didn't even respond.\n\nThe only one she spoke to was that sleaze Sidney Blumenthal, her friend who Obama told her you cannot deal with, and she did behind Obama's back. \n\nA Trump Administration will stop the reckless interventions, and instead focus on defeating and totally destroying ISIS. We're also going to build up our cyber defenses. Cyber's a big thing.\n\nAnd keep our power grid and our vital infrastructure modern and safe. And the word \"keep\" is an incorrect word because we have to rebuild it. It's a mess. Show Less Text\n\nIt's so old, it's falling apart. And we're going to use cyber offense to disrupt the enemy where we need to and keep them from recruiting online.\n\nISIS is taking our children, and taking our kids out of our country because they're using the internet better than we know how to use it. And we're the ones that came up with it.\n\nAt the same time, we're going to completely rebuild our very depleted military. We're going to take care of our people. \n\nAnd that includes building state-of-the-art systems of all kind. When it comes to keeping America safe, I believe in three very important words: peace through strength. We don't want to use the military. \n\nBut it's got to be there. \n\nAnd just in closing, to be strong, our country has to be rich again. We're a debtor nation. We're poor. I'm going to make America rich again. \n\nMy enemy--our enemies are unbelievable. They love what's happening to our country. They love it. Our energy proposals won't lock the $50 trillion in energy reserves right here in America under our feet.\n\nThis means new jobs in Florida and many, many other communities. Pennsylvania, Ohio, we're going to take care of our miners, we're going to take care of our steelworkers, we're going to take care of natural gas. We're going to have clean coal. We're going to also have all forms of advanced energy.\n\nWe also have to repeal and replace it. We will do this and it's so important because it's driving everybody and small businesses and big businesses and our country out of business. Repeal and replace Obamacare. \n\nBill Clinton, in a rare moment of truth-telling, said last week Obamacare was a crazy system where people wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half. What kind of a system is this?\n\nOh, did he suffer that evening. He went home aye yai yai, poor Bill. He suffered. You see, the next he came back and he said he was only kidding. He was only kidding. It's a disaster.\n\nObamacare - you know, your rates are going up 68 percent. In Texas they had 71 percent. In other communities they're going to go 95 percent and 100 percent, and next year is going to be worse. We have no choice but to absolutely repeal, replace Obamacare we're going to come up with a much better plan for much less money. \n\nAs you know also, most counties in the state will only have one insurer to choose from. Obama does that because that way they have a monopoly so they can charge you whatever the hell they want.\n\nThis is our chance to stop the abusive and horrible and--and something that doesn't work, Obamacare, and save American healthcare, but you have to get out and vote.\n\nAt the center of our economic revival, we'll be fixing our terrible trade deals. When I announced, seems like a long time now, June 16th coming down with Melania at the escalator, remember, in Trump Tower, was an amazing - that was an amazing thing and we announced that it was a big part.\n\nAnd then I came out and I said Florida and our countries, we have all of these lost jobs. All of our lost manufacturing. We're going to get it back. We're bringing our jobs back.\n\nWhen countries come in and think they're going to steal our companies and our companies are going to go out and fire all of their employees in Florida, in Ohio, in Pennsylvania, in all of these countries. All of these--everyone. We are not going to allow it to happen. We are not going to allow it.\n\nWe are going to tell it, you are going to have consequences. The states are not going to put up with it anymore. Our federal government is going to help.\n\nWe've built other countries at our expense. We have. So, if they come in like they did in Indiana - where Mike Pence, by the way, is doing a great job. \n\nAnd they take - in the case, they take - Mexico takes care of your air conditioner, and they fire their 1,400 people who were so great to me.\n\nAnd they think they're going to make air conditioners in their beautiful new plant in Mexico, and sell them across the border and make lots of money, and we have all the employment. Not going to happen. We're going to put a 35 percent tax on and they're staying in the United States \n\nAnd if they don't, we're going to make plenty of money. \n\nWe are going to rebuild our country. Our country is going to be a country where you can be proud of again. We're going to use American steel, we're going to use American labor, we are going to come first in all deals.\n\nWe're not going to make the trade deal where we come in fifth and sixth and seventh and other countries laugh at our stupidity. We are going to build great companies. We are going to expand companies that are now doing poorly. We are going to make our country very rich again.\n\nWe are going to make our country very safe again. \n\nWe are going to make America strong again. And we are going to make America great again. God bless you, everybody. God bless you. Thank you.\u0000","10":"So how good is he? How good is he? \nSpecial. Special. He is a special man and special person. And he has become my friend. Oh, there is a lot of people here. Whoa. \n\nHello, everybody. Your football team is going to have a great year. \n\nI watch. I watch. You've got the quarterback, you've got the whole deal. I think it's going to be a very good year. \n\nOK? And if you get into that Super Bowl, I will be going, all right?\n\nSo, you know, I wrote something down before, and I think it is important, because -- I love you too. \n\nBecause we need unity, we have to win this election. This is truly one of the most important elections, certainly in my lifetime. Because we are about to go -- we lose it, we are in the wrong direction, and maybe it's gone. Supreme Court justices, always remember that. But so many different levels, and when you see what happened with crooked Hillary today, it was a disaster. \n\nA disaster. She had a disaster. She lies folks, she lies badly. \n\nSo, I want to -- I just wrote this out. I wanted to say to the group, you know, I had a great time when I was in Wisconsin, and I did not quite eke it out. I thought I was going to, but after that, it worked out well. You built me up, you taught me about politics.\n\nAnd when I left here, I said, I think I've learned a lot. \n\nSo, I love it. I love the people. I have many friends in Wisconsin. And they're -- they're incredible people. You're incredible people, I have to tell you that. \n\nAnd we're going to have a lot of fun. We are going to have a lot of fun but I had to write this. This campaign is not about me or any one candidate. It is about America. \n\nIt is time for a change. We need a change. A real change, not an Obama change. We don't need an Obama change. We have had enough. It is time to change a rigged political system that works only for the insiders, and replace it with a government that serves the people. \n\nHave to do it. And know both sides. I've been on the other side. Believe me. I actually like this side better; this is a movement. This is a movement like they may be have never seen in this country, according to even the political pundits that truly hate me, OK? This is a -- they -- oh, this is a movement that some say, most say is one of the great phenomenon's that they've ever seen in politics.\n\nSome say it's the single greatest phenomenon. \n\nThough the media doesn't want to talk about it, we have done something -- we. All of us, together. I'm a messenger; I'm only a messenger. We have done something truly historic together, standing before you as nominee for president and I'm not a politician, proudly. \n\nI'm not part of the system. I ran against the system, and I'm probably better off running against the system. \n\nI ran against the donors. I'm my own donor, essentially. I have a lot of money under this deal. This is a very expensive crisis, I want to tell you. \n\nI funded -- as you know, I funded the primaries. And I'm in for under $60 million, and I'm largely funding my campaign as we go forward. In addition to that -- in addition to that, we have raised tremendous amounts of money, and much of it from small donors,$61; $61. As a Republican, that doesn't happen. It happens because of what you are seeing in front of you today.\n\nAnd if you remember, just prior to June, they did a story, \"Donald Trump has not really done too well with fund raising.\" Well, that is because I did not even know if I was getting the nomination. I'm not going to raise funds -- I would've had enough if I didn't make it. I would have said, \"Bye, bye, politics.\"\n\nBut I wanted to make sure -- so I got it. And then I started raising money for the Republican Party. and we raised a lot of money. We started really on June 14th, Flag Day, my birthday. My birthday. \n\nAnd in June, we raised approximately -- think of this -- $51 million. Can you imagine? \n\nAnd those people couldn't believe it; they were really surprised. Big headlines, you know. Because they don't give me too many good headlines. I could do the greatest things. I do things that I think a fantastic.\n\nI say, good, there is no way they cover this badly. And they cover it badly. I gently tell a woman that I love her baby, and let the baby cry. It is OK. As the baby that had a voice that was superior to Pavarotti continued to cry -- I remember, I told her to stay, don't worry, ma'am.\n\nBut after about 3 or 4 minutes, and I'm trying to speak and it was in Jacksonville, we had this massive, massive crowd, filled up the stadium. And the baby's screaming. So, I said, ma'am, I would like to reverse my order. Perhaps you could nicely take -- take the baby out. Your baby is great\n\nI did it so nicely. She was happy. Even the baby was happy. He stopped crying. \n\nAnd maybe you could take the baby out, would that be possible? The whole place was cracking up. And the next day in the newspaper, it said, \"Trump throws baby out of arena.\"\n\nTerrible. Now, they are very dishonest. That was a tough one, when I -- and I just had a reporter come up to me, backstage, a reporter come up -- \"Mr. Trump, sir, but why did you throw that baby out of the area?\" I said, \"I was having fun. I was so nice, I was so nice. Everybody likes me. The baby liked me, the mother liked me. We had a good time. I try to keep the baby in, but the baby was such -- had such a powerful voice \n\nIn fact, I want to find out who that baby is, because I want to sponsor the baby. And that baby will sing someday in Philharmonic Hall. I'm telling you. New York City. OK? The great Philharmonic. \n\nSo, I'm not part of the system. I ran against the system. I ran against the donors, because I'm largely my own donor. I'm running against myself. That's sort of -- never thought of it that way. And against the status quo, and the status quo, we have to get rid of, because it is not working, folks, because the country is a mess. \n\nAnd that is why put up a lot of money. But while the Democrats nominated the candidate of special interests, and really a candidate of total corruption, I mean, you take a look at what she is doing, the Republicans made history by choosing a nominee from outside of this very, very corrupt the system. It is a corrupt system.\n\nIt's a corrupt system. You want something done, they can do it for you. And that is not necessarily, and usually it isn't good for the country.\n\nThat is why we're going to be able to deliver real change, and real safety and real opportunity to all Americans. We have to unite. Remember that.\n\nEverything I've accomplished, I have done by putting together a really fantastic team, including Governor Mike Pence of Indiana, who has done an incredible... \n\nDone an incredible job. My wonderful staff of people that really love what we are doing, and they are working so hard. My family, friends, and it's expanding all the time.\n\nBut I need a Republican Senate and a House to accomplish all of the changes that we have to make. We have to make them, right? \n\nI understand and embrace the wisdom of Ronald Reagan's big tent within the party, big, big tent, remember? Ronald Reagan, great man, great guy. Remember he included Reagan Democrats and Independents and Republicans, a lot of people. We're going to have the same thing. There a lot of Democrats perhaps in this room, are there a lot of Democrats? Raise your hands. I mean, I don't think we need too many to be honest with you, but -- so I embraced the wisdom that my 80 percent friend is not my 20 percent enemy, Ronald Reagan. \n\nStated by Ronald Reagan, pretty good.\n\nWe will be the big tent party. We are going to have a lot of cross help. We are going to have a lot of Bernie Sanders people coming in because of trade, because Bernie Sanders knew we were being ripped off by trade. Trade is a disaster with China, with Japan, with Mexico, with Vietnam, with so many countries, with every country, every country.\n\nWe don't win at any level with anything, and as a unified party, we will lead our country to unity as well, very important. We need the unity, we have to win the election. \n\nNo we have to win it --- have to win it. Otherwise, our big movement was not as big as we thought and that's not good. That's why November 8th, you've got to get everybody you know -- and you know, all this voter ID nowadays, a lot of places aren't going to have voter ID. Now what does that mean? What does that mean? You just keep walking in and voting? So you have to be very careful, very vigilant -- you have to be careful\n\nBut we will have disagreements, but we will disagree as friends and never stop working together toward victory, and very importantly, toward real change. \n\nSo in our shared mission to make America great again, I support and endorse our speaker of the House, Paul Ryan. \n\nPaul Ryan, he's good. He's a good man. He's a good man and he's a good guy. And we may disagree on a couple of things, but mostly we agree and we're going get it done and we're going to do a lot of wonderful things. \n\nHe's a good man. And while I'm at it, I hold in the highest esteem Senator John McCain for his service to our country, in uniform and in public office, and I fully support and endorse his re-election. Very important. \n\nWe'll work together. I also fully support and endorse Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire. \n\nA state I truly love, primarily because that was my first victory, but I love New Hampshire. No, I love New Hampshire, one of the most beautiful places. She's a rising star and will continue to represent the great people of New Hampshire so very well for a long, long time. Senator Kelly Ayotte. \n\nWorking hand-in-hand, we will grow our majority in the House and in the Senate. We need that, we've got to get things done. Arm in arm, we will rescue the nation from the Obama-Clinton disaster, which is exactly what it is, that has bled our country dry and spread terrorism unabated across the world, that's what's happening. You saw it just now, Maps came out yesterday, they said ISIS far bigger, it's all over the place. It's all over the place. We're going to get rid of it, folks. \n\nOur military is depleted. We're going to build up our military, we are going to get others with us. Believe me, we're going to get plenty of others with us. And speaking of others, wouldn't it actually be wonderful if we could get along with Russia? Wouldn't that be nice? \n\nThey talk so big and so brave and so tough, they're the tough ones. You know, Hillary's real tough, give me a break. Wouldn't that be great? We get along with Russia, we go out together with others and we knock the hell out of ISIS, wouldn't that be great? \n\nTogether we will lead our country back to prosperity, security and peace. OK? When you look at the world and what's happened -- so we have the queen of corruption, she's the queen of corruption. She is a disaster. I said before, if crooked Hillary Clinton becomes president, terrorism will destroy the inner workings of our country. Believe me, they are loving it.\n\nShe wants to have 550 percent more people coming in from Syria and that region into our nation. And we don't know who they are, we don't know where they come from really, we don't know if they're ISIS, some will be. And look at the damage that's done in San Bernardino with a couple -- probably he became radicalized by her -- a couple, and these were friends of theirs. These were people that gave a party in celebration of the birth of their child and they were gunned down, 14 people killed, many, many injured.\n\nTake a look at Orlando -- take a look at Orlando, how disgusting that was. Take a look at the World Trade Center and so many other places. Go to the probably toughest gun laws anywhere in the world, go to Paris and take a look at that, 130 people gunned down. You know, if people had guns, on the other side where the bullets are flying in the other direction, like you sir, you sir, you and you, ma'am. \n\nFirst of all, if they knew guns were in the room, they probably wouldn't have gone there. There were no guns. They were just sitting ducks, 130 people. In San Bernardino you had 14 people.\n\nBut in Paris, just like this, boom -- get over here, boom -- get over here, boom -- 130 people with many still in the hospital, many so gravely wounded. It's horrible. And if they had bullets flying in the other direction, maybe they wouldn't have shown up, and if they did, I'll tell you what, you wouldn't have had that kind of carnage. You would have had people lying on the other side of the floor instead. \n\nSo Hillary Clinton wants to do major damage, as you know, to our Second Amendment. Hillary Clinton wants to put judges -- she wants to put justices of the Supreme Court -- she's going to make them nice and liberal, wait until -- wait until you see what that does to your rights. Wait until you see what that does to your Second Amendment. You will not recognize it, you will not recognize it. National Rifle Association, NRA, endorsed me. \n\nThey're great people, Wayne -- they're great people, Chris, they love this country. They endorsed me very early and it's really a -- it's really an honor. I'll tell you what, they are phenomenal people when you get to know them. They love the country -- you know, they love the country. They take a lot of heat, but they love the country, I'll tell you that right now.\n\nAnd I heard Mike, Governor Pence, talking about 1.2 growth -- 1.2 percent growth, the lowest in memory since the 1940's. When you think about it, it's the lowest. So a lot of differences between all of us, but I thought I would mention -- because I've known Hillary Clinton over the years -- I know her -- and she makes statements. She makes statements and they are statements coming out of her playbook.\n\nWell, let's see, \"we can't get them for this -- can't get them for this.\" I've always heard that I have the best temperament, people tell me I have the best temperament, I have a temperament to win. We got to win. We got to win\n\nShe said not so long ago, \"I don't like Donald Trump's tone\". Now, she is reading it off teleprompters only. \"I don't like Donald trump's tone.\" And I said, you know, \"we need a tough tone today. We have people -- we need a kind tone, but we need a tough tone.\"\n\nWe have people being beheaded all over the Middle East and other places. We have crime that is rampant. We have people in the Middle East being drowned in steel cages. This is like medieval times, and she is worried about my tone.\n\nSo they chop off heads and they drown people, and they bury people in sand. And then they ask me, \"Mr. Trump, sir,\" -- at one of the debates in which I won, I'm very happy about that -- \"Mr. Trump, sir, how do you feel about waterboarding?\" I'm seeing chopped off heads, drowned people, burying in sand -- I said, \"I'm absolutely OK with it, let me tell you.\" \n\nCan you imagine what the enemy must say -- can you imagine the enemy -- ISIS in this case -- can you imagine what they must say as they spent the day chopping off the heads of Christians -- \"come back, get together and start talking -- and they say waterboarding is not allowed in the United States -- by the United States, waterboarding is not allowed.\"\n\nFolks, we better get smart and tough and we are playing games with Hillary, we are playing games. It is just games, she is not the right person and everybody knows it. Her single greatest achievement is being caught in a crime and getting away with it. \n\nThis is true, 33,000 e-mails. \n\nSo I wrote this before on the way over to another rally at also a very nice place that's very full and very nice in Iowa. And we love Iowa don't we, yes? Right? \n\nI thought it was accurate, unstable -- and she is, she is unstable. Hillary Clinton lacks the judgment that Bernie Sanders had. You just have to pay attention, as soon as he said it, I started writing notes. \n\n\"She has bad judgment. She lacks the judgment, temperament and moral character to lead this country. Plus, she is a weak person.\" We don't need a weak person. He just said, \"plus, she is a criminal.\"\n\nShe is a dangerous liar who has disregarded the lives of Americans, and who has put all of us at great risk while supporting economic policies that have destroyed our economy. We have a long way to go.\n\nShe is unhinged, she's truly unhinged, and she is unbalanced, totally unbalanced. And you can see, in the words of a secret service agent who just wrote a book, I bought the book, I wanted to see what he had to say; \"she simply lacks the integrity and temperament to serve in the office.\"\n\n\"From my bottom of my soul\" he said, \"I know this to be true.\" He was there. \"Her leadership style, volcanic impulsive as it is, disdainful of the rules set for everyone else hasn't changed a bit. She's unqualified to become president.\" And she really is, and Bernie said that too. \n\nThank you. What great people. Wow.\n\nNo, but it is true, no games, it is true. In one way she is a monster, OK? Look at what happened, look at her history. In another way, she is a weak person, she is actually not strong enough to be president. So she's got both, but she is not strong enough to be president.\n\nShe will be a be a disaster. She will be so bad for our country, and I'm not just talking about Justices of the Supreme Court. She will be so bad for our country and we can't let it happen. We can't let it happen.\n\nYou know, Mike Pence told me a story, and maybe I should not say it, but I found it interesting, but of the reasons -- I guess the primary reason that he's in politics is because he watched the crookedness of the Clintons when they were in the White House. And he said \"he ran, he ran again and he ran again, and he won.\" You have to hand it to him, this is the guy that does not give up. He does not quit. He never ever quits. \n\nBut he watched the Clintons -- and I'm sure they will be thrilled to hear that -- but that actually got him into politics, which is interesting.\n\nSo then we make these horrible deals; Iran Deal, horrible deal, we got $150 billion -- and how about $400 million -- think of it, $400 million in cash, different currencies, different denominations. Now, lot of people say that money went toward terror\n\nI'm nicer than that, see, I don't have that horrible thought process that some people have in this room have. I say, some of it went to terror, but a lot of it went into their bank accounts, believe me, that's the way it is. It went into their pockets, can you imagine these guys sitting there with $400 million in cash? You think they're giving that money to terror, they are giving that money to them and I guess terror got some of it, but most of it they kept.\n\nI mean, the concept of paying $400 million in cash is mind- boggling. I mean, you wouldn't think -- who can authorize such a thing? Where did they get it? What did they do, go to a bank teller and say, \"give me $400 million in cash? I want to in euros, I want it in Swiss francs, wrap it up, we will come back in 10 minutes.\"\n\nI mean, it is just inconceivable. So we are witnessing a horror show in this country and throughout the world. You look at what is going on throughout the world with these same people, these people funding terror -- these people are funding terrorism. For us to have given $400 million to basically free our hostages.\n\nNow, Obama, just like he lied about Obamacare which was a tremendous lie, that was a tremendous lie, remember? \"You can keep your plan, you can keep your doctor.\" Really? How many people have been able to keep the doctor or their plan?\n\nKeep your plan, keep your doctor -- not working that way, folks. It is a disaster. By the way, it is going to be repealed and replaced 100 percent. \n\nAnd -- and honestly, I hope I win, because we will do a great job. We are going to make America great again. We're going to make America great again. \n\nBut I actually think that regardless of who wins, Obamacare is going to fold in any event. It is so expensive. People can't afford it and the country can't afford it. Other than that, it is just wonderful. So, in Texas, they just had almost a 60 percent increase. Now the increases are starting to come out. The big increase is going to be announced on November 1st. The election is November 8th. Folks, they want to delay it, because it is election-changing. It is a mess.\n\nIt is election changing, and they want to change it. And we can't let that happen.\n\nBecause the numbers -- and I can see some of the numbers already -- the numbers are going to be astronomical. They are going to be astronomical. They're going to be so big, so horrible, and the health care, you know, the plan is terrible. It's terrible. And we're going to take care of everybody, but we're going to end up with a great plan that costs much less money for the people and much less money for the country.\n\nThis plan is a total rip. It does not work, so it's going to fall, because economically, it is a disaster for the country, too.\n\nBut what about people where they said they had a 30, 40, 50, 60 percent increase? And it's going to be worse than that, I predict on November 1st.\n\nSo, we'd better get smart and we'd better start thinking properly.\n\nNow, I want to talk about what is going on at the borders, because money... \n\nOh, we're going to build it.\n\nSo, listen, so we have people coming to our country that should not be coming to our country . We have thousands and thousands of people from certain terrorist states, from certain parts of the world that we are allowing to come into our country.\n\nMost of the politicians, almost all of them don't even know where they are, where they are being put, they know nothing about these people. This could be the great Trojan Horse of all time. And Hillary wants thousands more to come in over and above Obama. Right?\n\nSo, tall -- and the wall is getting taller every day. \n\nIf you think of this, I just wrote this, the Obama-Clinton foreign-policy has handed huge portions of Iraq, Libya and Syria to ISIS. Huge portions. It has undermined stability in Egypt, and you know what they have to do over there. And empowered Iran as never before. Iran, three years ago was -- was dying. In fact, when they were marching in the streets, if Obama would have just encouraged them a little more, it would have been taken over by the people.\n\nBut Obama played ball with the thugs that are running it right now. Think of this, think of this. Look, look. We're making a deal, and the deal is not made, and they are dancing in the streets of Iran saying how stupid the Americans are to be making this deal.\n\nThe leaders, and in particular the leader of Iran, is calling us stupid, and the deal means nothing.\n\nAnd yesterday, I think he just said that the United States is essentially nothing.\n\nThis is our -- this is our great, great partner.\n\nBut when you have somebody -- if I was making this deal, and if the other side was bragging about it, the deal wasn't made, I'm not making that deal. I'm not making it. I'm walking.\n\nBut we kept it going, and we should have never ever started negotiating that deal until we had our hostages back. OK? \n\nWe should have walked. We should have doubled up the sanctions and walked. And they would have -- and I say it. Before the plane reached New York City or Washington, you could just turn it around, because they'll call you, they'll say, let's go. Take your hostages.\n\nBut when you think about it, you probably read today and yesterday, one of the hostages was waiting for a very long period of time. Now, Obama said that it had nothing to do with the hostages. That he would not do that for kidnappers.\n\nHe would not do that for kidnapping. OK? No, no, think of that. You have got to think about it. He wouldn't do it -- now, it was the same day, right, same day. We have to be exactly accurate, because they'll catch us, right? Same day.\n\nThe money came in, and one of the hostages, a good guy, I saw him interview on television. Good guy, hard time. Btu didn't he say he waited forever, he waited. And somebody said, nope, we are waiting for either something or a plane to come in.\n\nAnd here Obama stands up yesterday, and for seven minutes is telling us one thing had nothing to do with the other. Just a lie. You know, at least be truthful. \n\nAnd we're talking about the same day, $400 million, and we could have had something that would have been a much better deal. And you know what, I'm all in favor of deals when it gets to nuclear. But we could have made it -- we should have walked. And we should have walked with $150, too; we have said, sorry, we don't have the money, can't pay. We don't have the money. We owe almost $20 trillion\n\nI'm sorry, fellas, we love you, we think you're the greatest guys on Earth. But we can't give you the money. We don't have it. And they will get angry and they will be upset, and two days later, you'll be back negotiating.\n\nYou just saved yourself $150 billion, right? Hundred and -- $150 billion. \n\nSo, we have terrorists pouring into our country, we have people coming in. I don't know if you saw this, in Maine -- and Maine knows, because Maine is -- I was up there yesterday -- a great place. A great governor, great governor. Paul is doing a great job.\n\nAnd I think the most important issue facing civilization right now is radical Islamic terrorism. And we have a president that refuses to use the term, and we have crooked Hillary who does not want to use it. Now, she's being forced to use it by me.\n\nDid you notice she gave a speech, she said, I will use it. She called it, I think, radical Islam. But she said, I will use it. I will. Just like the Trans-Pacific Partnership. She called it the gold standard. It is a horror show.\n\nIt's almost as bad or maybe it's going to worse than NAFTA, signed by her husband, which cleaned out many of the states in our country, cleaned them out from manufacturing. Moved to Mexico and other places. NAFTA, a total disaster.\n\nNAFTA, signed by Bill Clinton. He never suffered the ravages, because he signed it, then he got out and other people did suffer with it.\n\nBut we are going to renegotiate NAFTA, and if they don't want to make a great deal for us so we get our jobs back, at least a lot of them, if we can't make a great deal -- and she can't do that, by the way, if she wanted to.\n\nNumber one, her donors would not let her. Her special interests would never let her. Her lobbyists would never let her.\n\nNumber three, she could not do it anyway. Even if she wanted to.\n\nBut we're going to renegotiate. And did you hear her the other day? After years of saying how wonderful it is, even though you look at New England, and you look at New York state and you look at Pennsylvania and Ohio, if you look at a lot of other places, one of the reasons I won Indiana so big -- well, one of the reasons was the great Bobby Knight, OK?\n\nBobby Knight in Indiana. \n\nThat's gold standard right? As she said about TPP. But one of the reasons I won was because Carrier Air Conditioning was moving to Mexico from Indiana, and they let go of 1,400 people.\n\nAnd I've been talking about this, and I know how to stop it, and you've heard me before, so easy to stop. There have to be consequences when Mexico takes our companies. And not only Mexico; there have to be consequences when China devalues its currency so that our companies can no longer compete with China, even though we make better product.\n\nI have friends who are manufacturers. We make better product. They can't get their product into China And when a few times arise where they can, they have to pay an incredible tax, beyond what anybody would even think costs. But yet, we open our doors and just throw away your stuff, and we lose our jobs and it is very, very said.\n\nBut look, as many know, a major destination -- Maine, has become a major destination for Somali refugees. We admit hundreds of thousands of refugees into the United States from many of the most dangerous and unstable regions in the world. And you are getting them here too folks, you just don't know it because you just don't know.\n\nAnybody in this room -- anybody in this room from a terror territory? All right, a practice -- and this is a practice which will continue under Hillary Clinton except it will expand five, six, seven fold. I don't get it. I mean, I know they will vote Democrat, OK, that's what I know, but they will not be voting for a long time.\n\nI just -- I don't get it, how can anybody even think this way? Now, the Washington Times reported, \"of the Somali refugees -- the program in Minnesota -- that the effort to resettle large groups of Somali refugees is having the unintended consequence of creating an enclave of immigrants with high unemployment that is both stressing the state safety net\" -- tremendous problems for safety -- \"and creating a rich pool of potential recruiting targets for the Islamic terror groups\n\nAren't we smart? We are having this problem across our refugee and immigration programs. Here are some of the examples -- I will give you a few examples, and this came out of the Senate subcommittee just recently. \"The Boston bombers\" -- remember those horrible, disgusting people? \"The Boston bombers arrived through the political asylum process.\n\nThe younger brother applied for citizenship and was naturalized on September 11, 2012. The older brother had a pending application for citizenship.\" And look what happened, we took them in. Look what happened, aren't we smart?\n\nThe Moroccan national who came to the United States on a student visa was arrested for plotting to blow up a university in a federal courthouse. Great. A Uzbek refugee living in Idaho was arrested and charged with providing support to a terrorist organization in the form of teaching terror recruits how to build massive and very dangerous bombs. We let him in.\n\nAn immigrant from Syria who later applied for and received U.S. citizenship was accused by federal prosecutors of planning to go to a military base in Texas and kill three or four American soldiers, execution style if possible -- more than that, if at all possible.\n\nA college student who immigrated from Somalia who later applied and received U.S. citizenship, attempted to blow up a Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Oregon.\n\nAn immigrant from Afghanistan who later applied for and received U.S. citizenship, and a legal permanent resident from the Philippines were convicted for plotting to join Al Qaida and the Taliban in order to kill as many Americans as possible -- as many as possible.\n\nAn Iraqi immigrant who later applied for and received U.S. citizenship was arrested for lying to federal agents about pledging allegiance to ISIS, his travels to Syria, and how many Americans he wanted to kill.\n\nTwo immigrants from Pakistan who later applied for and received U.S. citizenship were sentenced to decades long prison sentences for plotting to detonate a bomb -- and a very big bomb, in the middle of New York City.\n\nAn immigrant from Yemen who later applied for and received U.S. citizenship was arrested for trying to join ISIS. He was also charged with attempting to illegally buy firearms to try to shoot as many American military personnel as possible.\n\nAll right folks. So, I just say, what are we doing? What are we doing? And Hillary Clinton wants more and more to pour in. You can almost say, you know, politics aside, whether you are a Democrat, whether you are a liberal, a Republican, a conservative; what are they doing? I don't care who you are, what the hell are they doing? \n\nSo we are going to have strong borders, our southern border is going to be very powerful. We are going to stop the drugs from pouring into Wisconsin and every place else. \n\nThe heroin epidemic is beyond belief. In New Hampshire, a great place, that is where I realized the extent of what is going on. I met with the people of New Hampshire and they tell me, \"the biggest problem they have is heroin.\" I said, \"it can't be with the beautiful lakes and streams, it so beautiful.\" Right, and their biggest problems heroin. I said, \"you have to be kidding, that can't be right, \" and it was. Their youth is being poisoned. And then you go to Massachusetts, and you go to North Carolina, and South Carolina, and you come here, you come here -- I just left Iowa, you go to Iowa and you see the tremendous problems they have with heroin and drugs that pour in from the southern border. And look, here's the story, we are going to have strong borders. We are going to have a wall, it will be a big and powerful wall -- a big powerful wall. \n\nYou know that Hillary Clinton wanted a wall a number of years ago? She wanted a wall. And the primary research, as we understand it, looking back, not that long ago, she wanted a wall. You know, walls do work folks, all you have to do is ask Israel. All you have to do is ask some of the nations that are in Europe right now that are building walls.\n\nYou know, it's sort of interesting, Obama talks about, \"there will be no wall.\" But in the White House, which he just said, which is true, they want to build essentially a wall, they want to build a fence a lot bigger, and a lot higher, and a lot stronger.\n\nYou know, it is interesting. I say, \"don't build that fence right, don't build that fence,\" because they say, \"walls don't work\" -- fences don't work, don't build that fence.\"\n\nWhen Hillary doesn't want to let you have your guns, she is surrounded by people like this that have more firepower on them than any human beings on earth, and I think she doesn't want to have guns. I think that all of her bodyguards and all of her Secret Service should immediately give up their weapons. \n\nOK, I mean it. They should immediately give up their weapons. They should immediately give up those weapons and if somebody comes at you with a gun, you just try to talk them out of it, I guess. You got to do some quick talking.\n\nYou got to do some quick talking, Hillary. I don't think even Hillary with her phony lies and disgusting habits, I don't think Hillary could get away with that one. \n\nSo we are going to have a little contrast. And I did this very quickly but it is so simple, Hillary wants to raise taxes, Trump is going to lower taxes very substantially, the biggest tax decrease of all on business and on person.\n\nHillary wants to significantly expand regulations. Trump is going to get rid of many, many, many regulations. \n\nWhich, by the way, are stopping your businesses both small and big from succeeding, from expanding and more than anything, from starting. You can't start a business today the regulations are so onerous and horrible.\n\nHillary wants to shut down energy production.  Trump wants to expand it significantly. And we'll start paying off our debt. \n\nHillary wants to essentially abolish the Second Amendment, take away your right.  Donald Trump will protect it more so than any president that has ever served. \n\nCrooked Hillary wants far left activities judges forced over there by Bernie and by Pocahontas. \n\nWho will destroy our Constitution. I want judges who will support and defend our Constitution. \n\nAs close, by the way, to Justice Scalia who was great as we could get, OK? \n\nHillary wants to open our borders, just open them up because her special interests and donors want it that way. There are reasons, I understand that. I want to totally secure our borders. But I want people to come in. But they come in through a process and they come in legally. \n\nHillary wants to invade foreign countries. You ever see the one where she says \"Donald Trump with the nuclear\" -- I'm -- I didn't want the war in Iraq. And I'm on record. I didn't want the war in Iraq. I didn't want all of -- what they've done. And I said, if you read Esquire Magazine from a long time ago, you'll see everything I said was exactly right. It's going to de-stabilize the Middle East.\n\nI said the meanest, toughest group of people, the people that hate the United States and its people the most, they're going to take it over. That's exactly what's happening. They're taking over the oil, they're taking over the land, they're taking over everything. I didn't want it, but I'm always being accused like the war hog they think I'm a tough guy, the war hog. Right?\n\nThey think she wants to be tough with Russia. So she said well, Donald Trump likes Putin. I don't know Putin, folks. I don't know. I hope I like him, I hope he likes me because I'd love to get along with Russia. OK? \n\nLove to. But I don't know. But she goes Donald Trump, Donald Trump -- think about it -- wants to befriend Putin and other things, she said right? And I'm saying to myself what's wrong with that? That's good.\n\nBut she's going to be the tough one, see? She's going to be the tough one. She's going to play with nuclear weapons, you know? They have all the nukes, nice nukes. She's going to be the tough one.\n\nI'll tell you what, you put her in the office of the president -- you know, she hates Putin and Putin hates her, right? That's what I hear. No, no -- Putin probably doesn't respect her more than anything else. But Putin hates her. But she's going to be tough. We're going to be tough with Russia -- oh, we're going to be tough, right? Let me tell you, we're in a different world today, folks. We're in a different world.\n\nBut she makes it sound like I'm this tough guy that will have a temperament. You know, she uses the word -- you know who gave her the word? Her people that write the speeches, we'll say Trump with a temperament.\n\nThey said Trump in a speech with tweets. I've got -- I've got between Facebook and Twitter like almost 21, 22 million people. It's an asset, it's an asset. I tweet well. But -- but she said -- she made the statement during her speech, you know, I heard it barely because I was falling asleep, you couldn't watch it. \n\nAll right. So remember that one. Hillary wants to invade foreign countries. Look at Libya. Look at that. We did a great job there. You know, a spot hit on Gaddafi maybe, but I mean even that, what the hell do we get out of this? It's a disaster. Then you have Benghazi, then you have ISIS -- then you have ISIS -- then you have ISIS taking over the oil, large portions of the oil. And it's some of the finest oil in the world. And you have ISIS grabbing it.\n\nWe don't know what we're doing. We have people that don't know what we're doing. We have people that militarily -- in fact, they said well, who is your military consultants? And I give them names. But they're not working now, you know they're not working now. And I said of course they're not working now, look what working now people have gotten us. Havoc, who the hell wants the people who are working now? I mean... \n\nYou know, a lot of it's common sense and a lot of it's instinct and she has very bad judgment, she's got no instinct whatsoever. And when I was asked on one of the big networks about NATO, they said what do you think of NATO? Now, you know it's not like it was my primary subject in all fairness. I've only been doing this for 12 months. Now, it's actually almost 14 months, hard to believe, right?\n\nBut NATO -- so I said I know enough. And sometimes knowing a little is better than knowing too much. You understand, you can't see the forest through the trees, right? So I said NATO in my opinion is obsolete because it's not covering terrorism. Obsolete for that reason and also you have many countries that aren't paying their fair share, they're not paying what they're supposed to be paying. \n\nAnd we're protecting those guys and we're supposed to get into World War III for all these countries that aren't paying their fair share. And even the commander of NATO -- and I so respect what he did. He came out the other day and he said Donald Trump is right, we have cut you see that's right did you see the letter -- the big story? Donald Trump is right. I'm sure Obama was thrilled when he saw that. \n\nDonald Trump is right; you have countries that aren't paying. And he said how he goes in and he talks to them. He says look, you've got to pay your bills. I have budgets -- which is true. And I have to go back to Congress and I have to say what's happening.\n\nThey don't pay their bills though because people don't ask properly. And they probably say to the president or whoever may handle the country. \"Sir, we owe the United States millions of dollars. We're ready to pay.\" Oh, have they asked for the money? No. They'll pay, OK\n\nBut I will say the commander of NATO said I was right. And then you have these people back here -- stupid people -- right here. They said Donald Trump -- now they're the worst. They're the worst. They said Donald Trump -- Donald Trump doesn't like NATO. He is going to abandon NATO. That's not what I said. I said they've got to pay. They've got to pay.\n\nNow, you have to walk. You may have to walk. But they've got to pay. We're going to get in World War III for all these countries that are laughing at the stupidity of the United States, right? No, they've got to pay. And they probably will, in all fairness.\n\nBut Hillary said about Japan -- because Japan, we're defending Japan you know that, right? Now, in all fairness before I came alone put yourself back three years ago. Did anybody know that we defend Japan? Raise your hand who knew. All right, there's about 12 percent.\n\nNot bad. I think some of you are lying, OK? I think some of you are related to Hillary Rodham Clinton. I think some of you are lying. But we defend Japan and a man comes up, general or something, a few months ago, I remember so vividly. And he said at a news conference because they were embarrassed because I kept saying they've got to pay their way. And if they don't -- if they don't, you always have to be prepared to walk you have to do that.\n\nYou know, we don't want to do that, I understand the reason. It'd be nice to have them but you know this isn't again 40 years ago. We owe $20 trillion. We're defending all these -- we defend Japan. We defend Germany. We defend Saudi Arabia. You think they have the money to pay -- how about we have military bases that we rent -- we pay rent to Saudi Arabia to protect them? No. No, think of it. Think of it, think of the stupidity. Think of the stupidity. So this general comes up, has a news conference a few months ago. And he said, \"Mr. Trump doesn't understand that Japan is paying 50 percent of the cost to defend them.\"\n\nSo a reporter goes up who I think is there and said to me, \"Mr. Trump, we'd like your comment. They say that Japan is paying 50 percent of the cost to defend.\" And I said why aren't they paying 100 percent? The reporter said, OK.\" Not a bad question. Now, here's the problem with the Hillary -- Hillary rotten Clinton. Here's the problem. \n\nHere is -- that's why she changed her last -- that's why she doesn't want to use the name anymore, because everybody was saying that. I don't know. I've been saying it.\n\nBut look, here is -- here is why it doesn't work for Hillary. She saw that I said that we have to get reimbursed for our costs, at least, right?\n\nJapan, economic behemoth. Germany -- see how well they're doing -- economic behemoth. Saudi Arabia, nothing but money.\n\nThey were making $1 billion a day with their high oil prices, now they're making a fortune, the same thing. Economic behemoth. Why are defending them, and why aren't we being fully reimbursed? Now, if we do that, your budget already is starting to look real good, OK. You know, you have budgets, so we losing our assurance; we have an $800 billion trade deficit, folks.\n\nWe trade with companies. We have a deficit with other countries, think of it -- $800 billion a year. Trade deficit. Do we make the deals? no.\n\nWith China, $505 billion trade deficit. And they cheat us because they devalue their currency all the time. Whenever it gets a little bit tough, devalue, devalue, and our companies can't compete with that. Right?\n\nSo, here's the thing. So, Hillary says about Japan, how dare he not not stay with our allies, how dare he not do that?\n\nI will never abandon our allies, ever, ever, ever. Now, how do you negotiate when you're telling somebody will never going to leave? We may have to leave.\n\nLook, Japan has problems because you have the maniac in North Korea making missiles. But I mean, you know, so we'll get it.\n\nNow, South Korea, it is an economic behemoth. You can't buy television that is not made in South Korea, except Sony, which is made in Japan, which has sort of lost its way. Whether it is LG or Samsung. I order thousands of television sets; you can't buy them in the United States. I'd love to. Show me one company. One of the pundits said, they do make them. There's a company.\n\nAnd he showed me, it's a little company. What they do is, all the parts come in for -- from all over the world; they put them together, and they give you a television that doesn't work and nobody ever heard of it. \n\nAnd then I put it into a luxury hotel, and everybody complains, right?\n\nSo, you can't say to people when you're negotiating -- because we're talking about tremendous billions and billions of dollars. You can't say to people -- you can't say to people when you're negotiating, we'll never leave you.\n\nThink of this, we're going to never leave you; we love you, we'll never leave you. Could you pay more? No, we're not going to pay anymore. You're not going to leave us. Why should we pay more?\n\nSo, there's a chance we'll have to leave. And there's a chance that, you know, Japan will have to take over this monster and figure it out. We're very far away. It's very expensive.\n\nYou know, we have a treaty with Japan. And if the United States is attacked, they don't have to do anything. But if Japan is attacked, we have to go in there will our full force and might, and who the hell knows what's going to happen, right\n\nWorld War III, who knows what's going to happen. But if we're attacked, they don't have to do anything. You tell me, who makes these deals?\n\nIt's like Sergeant Bergdahl, right? So, we trade a dirty, rotten traitor where five or maybe even six people were killed when he deserted, and we knew that they were killed and we knew that he was a traitor. We trade for five of the greatest killers, the greatest killers in the Middle East, the five people that they wanted the most. That is our deal.\n\nSo, we get a traitor and they get five people that are right now, most of them, already back on the battlefields trying to kill everybody, including us.\n\nNo more, folks. That is called the five for one president. That's -- that is the same guy that made the deal for $400 million. The other guys couldn't leave the airport, the hostages. And then all of a sudden, they were able to leave.\n\nAnd then you watched him yesterday saying that, can you believe it? This had nothing to do with that. OK? Just a coincidence. No, no, just a coincidence -- no. You know, she is unfit to serve as president for a lot of reasons. He is unfit also. He has done so bad. He has been so incompetent. We have doubled our debt during his -- think of it. Over the years of our country -- over the years of our country, he gets in, and in eight years by the time his term is up, we will have doubled our national debt.\n\nThink of it. So, we have to win this election. This is a very important election. I do not need to do this, folks, believe me. I could be elsewhere right now, I love being with you.\n\nBut I could be elsewhere. I could be -- I might be in Wisconsin, just a different location. OK? But I felt I had to do it. I want to give back. I will get back give back, I'm going to give back. I'm going to give back. \n\nI want to give back. Because our country does not win anymore.\n\nOur country does not win anymore. And it is not going to win with crooked Hillary Clinton. Not going to win. It's not going to win. She does not know how to win. Our country is not going to win with her.\n\nWe're going to be worse than we are with Obama. I mean, if you want four more years of what is going on, ISIS, all over the place, ISIS expanding.\n\nAnd by the way, our policeman are great, great people. \n\nAnd we are not going to allow our policeman to be shot down anymore. Anymore. No more. No more.\n\nSo, November 8th, you have a big election. I promise you this, if I win, we're going to start winning again. We are going to win on trade, we're going to win with our military, we're going to take out ISIS, we are going to win for our veterans who have been totally mistreated.\n\nOur veterans are great. We have a great plan for the veterans. We're are going to win for our veterans, first time, maybe ever.\n\nWe are going to win on trade deals. We are going to make the finest, we are going to bring our jobs back. We're not going to make it easy for these companies to leave and fire everybody. It going to be very, very expensive when they do it.\n\nBelieve me, it's going to be very, very expensive. They're going to say, you know what? Maybe we'll stay Wisconsin, OK? Maybe we will stay. \n\nNo, it's going to be very, very hard. We're going to have strong borders, we're going to have the wall. Mexico is going to pay for the wall 100 percent, 100 percent. \n\nWe are going to get rid of Obamacare. We're going to get rid of Common Core, we're going to bring our education -- local. We're going to have local education.\n\nWe're going to appoint great Supreme Court justices. \n\nAnd folks, we're going to start winning again. We're going to win at every level. We're going to win so much, you're going to get tired of winning, I'm telling you.\n\nYou're going to be begging me, Mr. President -- you will send your great quarterback, right? He will come to the White House. Everybody respects him. He'll come to the White House, and he'll say, Mr. President, the people of Wisconsin, they can't stand winning so much. \n\nCould you tone it down just a little bit? I will say, I just can't do that. We are going to win more, and more and more, we're going to win at every level.\n\nBut we are going to win. We are going to make America great again. We're going to make America safe again.\n\nThank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you.\u0000","11":"Go, Daytona Beach! Wow. Thank you. Thank you so much. \n\nNow, I think you and I agree the choice is pretty clear between a president who's ready to bring us together, keep us safe, and make the economy work for everyone, not just those at the top, and someone who is temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified for the job.\n\nNow, I promise you this: I will never stop working for you every single day as a candidate and most importantly as your president. That's how I was raised. When I was over at B-CU I met one of the Methodist ministers because B-CU is affiliated with the Methodist Church, and I felt right at home. And my mother - my mother taught me to never, ever quit. Now what does that mean? Well, that means everybody gets knocked down. What matters is whether you get back up. And I've been fighting for families and underdogs my entire life, and I'm not stopping now. We're just getting started.\n\nAnd let's always remember what our wonderful First Lady told us: 'When they go low, we go high.' So no matter what they throw at us in these last days, we're not going to back down. We're not going to get distracted. We're not going to get knocked off course. Because we know how much the election matters. We know how many people are counting on us. And that's why we're going to reject Donald Trump's dark and divisive vision about America.\n\nWe are going to stick together and we are going to win on November the 8th. Right? Because Donald Trump's strategy is pretty simple. They've even said it in his campaign. It's to get women to stay home, get young people to stay home, get people of color to stay home, and get a lot - get a lot of smart, intelligent men to stay home too. Now, this is all part of his scorched earth campaign. It goes against everything we stand for. And you know how we stop him? By showing up with the biggest turnout of voters in American history.\n\nWe need more of everybody to vote - more women, more young people, more people of color, more African Americans, more Latinos, everybody. Let's break every record that we've ever had for voting. Let's make that the story of this election. And here in Florida you can, as you often have, make the difference. Right, Florida? If you all vote and you get everybody you know to vote, if you go out and talk to people today and every day about what's at stake in this election, then we will make history. We will win up and down the ballot. And I feel strongly about this, because we need people in Washington who are problem-solvers, not problem-makers. That's why I hope you'll vote to send Patrick Murphy to the Senate. He will be an independent voice for Florida families. And this is important: Unlike his opponent, Patrick has never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump.\n\nNow, here's some really good news. We just reached a milestone. More than 200 million Americans are registered to vote. That is the highest number ever. And that includes 50 million young people. That's the most in history. And you know what else? More than 16.5 million people have already voted in this election. And more than 3 million of those votes have been right here in Florida. Now, you only see numbers like we're seeing here in Florida when people are standing up for what they really believe in. Americans are coming together, and I know because I hear from people who are Republicans and Independents who are joining us to reject hate and division, rejecting Donald Trump's demeaning treatment of women, his plans to break up immigrant families and deport millions of people, his lie that President Obama wasn't born in America.\n\nI'll tell you, we have learned who Donald Trump is. Now it's up to us to show who we are. And the energy that we are seeing is not just about what we're against, it's about what we're for. It's about a common vision that we share for a hopeful, dynamic, unified America where everyone counts, everyone has a place, everyone willing to work can get ahead and stay ahead, where women are respected - where veterans are honored, where workers are paid fairly, where marriage is a right and discrimination is wrong.\n\nSo my friends, it is not just the fact that my name will be on the ballot. Everything we care about is at stake - your future - making college affordable, helping you pay back your debt - the cost of prescription drugs down - protecting and defending Social Security and Medicare from privatization and Wall Street schemes. Fighting climate change is at stake. LGBT equality is at stake. Equal pay for women is at stake. In the end, we know that American dream itself is at stake.\n\nNow, did any of you see the debates?\n\nWell, I'll tell you, I stood next to Donald Trump for three debates, four and a half hours, proving conclusively I have the stamina to be president and commander-in-chief. But I have to tell you, he said a lot of things that were troubling. But in that last debate, he said something that was truly horrifying. He is the first person of a major party, Republican or Democrat, ever to refuse to say he would respect the outcome of the election. Now, we can think about every issue we care about, but you know, after attacking women and African Americans and Latinos and people with disabilities and Muslims and POWs and everybody, now he's attacking the institutions of democracy. And so it comes down to this. When your kids and grandkids ask, 'What did you do in the 2016 election when everything was on the line,' I want you to be able to say you voted for a better, fairer, stronger America.\n\nAnd the way we're going to do that: We're going to turn everybody out. Early voting has begun right here in Volusia County. Every day from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. until November 5th you can vote. The nearest early voting site is just one mile away from here at the Volusia County Library Center in City Island. So don't wait one more day. Go vote, and then help us get everybody else out to vote too.\n\nNow, I know - I know that we've got our canvass organizers up here. I don't want to take too much of their time because they are workers, they are organized, they are focused. I'm so grateful to them and to you, and we need you. We need you. Stakes couldn't be higher. We got to do everything we can. I don't want anybody waking up on November 9th and saying, 'Oh, I wish I had just done a little more.' So help us knock on doors, make phone calls, talk to voters, and ask them, 'When are you going to vote? Do you know where you're going to cast your ballot? Who will you take with you?' And make sure they know about early voting, already begun here in Florida. And then if you need to, sign up yourselves. We have signups for three more shifts between now and Election Day. And this is going to be a close election; they always are these days. And we're going to win because of you, because of hardworking volunteers like you. And if you know anybody thinking about voting for Donald Trump, stage an intervention. Remember, friends don't let friends vote for Trump.\n\nAnd think about it this way. On January 20th, we're going to have a new president. And I'll tell you what, I will be proud to build on the progress we've made under President Obama and go even further. But I can't do any of the things that I'm talking about, any of the plans that I have, unless you help me. So that's what I'm asking you. That's why I came to Daytona Beach today. I came to ask you to help me in these last ten days. Let's give every American a chance to chart their own future, make their own contributions. Let's build a future we can all be proud of, and let's make sure we prove once and for all that love trumps hate.\n\nThank you.\u0000","12":"It is a glorious night here at the university, in Columbus, in the great state of Ohio. And I am thrilled to be here with all of you. And I want to thank Tony for his introduction. He made the greatest case against my opponent, didn't he? Thank you, Tony. And thanks to Mayor Ginther and Congresswoman Beatty and to my great friend, your former governor, and with your help, the next senator, Ted Strickland.\nAny of you see that debate last night? I'll tell you what, I'm not sure you'll ever see anything like that again. At least I hope you won't. It was such a clear display of what's at stake in this election. And I am thrilled to have the chance to talk with all of you about what we can do together, because I truly believe we are stronger together. To move our country forward.\n\nNow, the one thing I thought about last night and said was, as I was standing there on the stage with my opponent, was to remember what Michelle Obama had said. To paraphrase her, one of us went low and one of us went high. I want you to understand, I want to be a president for all Americans. I think the American dream is big enough for everybody. And I am honored to have support, not just from Democrats, but from independents and Republicans, because we've got to pull this country together if we're going to move into the future together, creating what we need for ourselves and our children.\n\nNow, I got to tell you, tomorrow is a big day in Ohio for this election because tomorrow, October 11th, is the last day to register in Ohio. And I hope every one of you will take your phones out, go to iwillvote.com, to confirm that you are registered. Because we want everybody to vote and we particularly want young people to vote because this is your election more than anybody else's.\n\nWhen I think about the challenges that we're facing, I don't think any one person has all the answers. I think we have to listen to each other and respect each other and celebrate our diversity, because that makes us smarter as well as stronger.\n\nDonald Trump spent his time last night attacking me when he should have been apologizing. We all heard on that tape what he thinks of women and how he treats women. And last night he doubled down on his excuse, saying that, well, it's just locker room banter. You know what's happened today, which is so interesting, is that a lot of athletes and coaches from the NBA, from Major League Baseball, from the NFL and more, have been coming forward, tweeting, they've been saying, no, that's not what happens in our locker rooms. And I just happen to think that our athletes and our coaches know a lot more about what happens in locker rooms than Donald Trump does.\n\nBut it wasn't just this one video that was so disturbing, even shocking. We have seen this kind of behavior throughout this entire campaign, and it's not just about women. Yes, he's insulted and demeaned women; we've seen it over and over again. But he has targeted others as well. He's disrespected and denigrated African Americans and Latinos, Muslims and POWs, people with disabilities and immigrants. He is an equal-opportunity insulter if there ever was one.\n\nThat is not what we are in America. And it may be who he is, but this election is our chance to show who we are. We are better than that. We are bigger than that. And I want to send a message to every boy and girl, every man and woman in our country, indeed, to the entire world, that that is not who America is. And we can do that by making sure that we turn out in the biggest numbers ever. Some analysts are saying we may have the biggest presidential election than we've had in a really long time. And the main reason is because your generation, the young people of America, are the most tolerant, open and generous generation in American history.\n\nYou know what's at stake, but you also know what you believe. And you don't want someone who says that he's going to appoint Supreme Court justices who will reverse marriage equality; who will - who will keep Citizens United, one of the worst decisions ever made, that allowed dark, unaccountable money in our electoral system; that will reverse a woman's right to make her own health care decisions; who will defund Planned Parenthood. You know better than that. You are helping us move toward a more perfect union. That has been the story of America at our best. We keep widening the circle of opportunity and inviting more people in. If you're willing to do your part, you're willing to make your contribution, there is a place for you in this nation of ours.\n\nWe don't have to make America great. We've got to do what we can to make sure it remains great and it becomes greater because we keep broadening that circle of opportunity.\n\nAnd please, never forget America is great because America is good, and if we deviate, if we deviate from our fundamental values - and that's indeed the kind of campaign my opponent has run. He has said he would order our men and women in uniform to commit war crimes. He has said he would impose a religious test on who could come into our country - a nation founded on religious freedom and liberty. This is turning the clock back, not just a few years, but centuries. The only way to rebuke this is to vote. Use the single most important, fundamental right you have as citizens of America.\n\nAnd when you do, I want you to know what you're voting for, because I don't want you just to vote against something. I want you to vote for something. And here's what we're going to do.\n\nI believe our economy should work for everyone, not just those at the top. So I am ending this campaign the way I started my career all those years ago when I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund. As soon as I got out of law school, I said, I don't want to do anything else other than work hard and advocate for kids and families. So I was fortunate to have the chance to be really on the front lines of a lot of change, helping to get the law that enabled people, kids with disabilities, to go to school. Now, most of you may not have any reason to remember this because you weren't born, but - there was a time in our country not so long ago when if you had a disability, if you lived in a school district, there was no requirement that they make accommodations for you. And literally millions of kids were denied an education. I went door to door getting information about what was going on with these children so that I could contribute a report to a big national effort to go to the Congress and say, this is wrong - in America, we're better than this. Open the doors of our schools to kids with disabilities.\n\nAnd then I was privileged to work to make sure that we got young people out of adult jails and prisons where they had no reason to be in the first place.\n\nSo when Donald Trump talks about what I've been doing for the last 30 years, I welcome that. I welcome it because in the 1970s, I was working to end discrimination and he was being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination against people in his apartments. And in the 1980s, I was working to improve the schools in Arkansas to make sure that teachers were well paid and that the coursework was going to prepare kids for the future, while he was getting a loan for $14 million from his father to start a business. And in the 1990s, I went to the UN Conference on Women and said women's rights are human rights - while he was insulting Miss Universe, Alicia Machado. And on the day - on the day that I was in the Situation Room watching the raid that brought Osama bin Laden to justice, he was hosting Celebrity Apprentice. So if he wants to talk about what we have been doing the last 30 years, bring it on.\n\nSo we've got to make up our minds about what kind of economy we want. And I'm pretty clear about that. I think we want new jobs with rising incomes. And I want us to have the biggest new jobs effort since the end of World War II. And I have some specific ideas in mind. We are going to have a big investment in infrastructure: our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports, our water systems. They need to be upgraded and maintained and built. That is a question of competitiveness. We have to have a competitive economy. Our airports are so rundown we don't even have one airport in our entire country in the top 25 in the world because we're not using the newest technology. We're not really prepared to do what we need to to invest in you and invest in those new jobs.\n\nI do want to bring advanced manufacturing. I heard Ted Strickland talking about that. I think we can have a manufacturing renaissance. There is no reason that we cannot own new manufacturing. I'm not interested in a race to the bottom, in competing for low-wage jobs. I am interested in competing for the high-wage jobs. So let's lead in precision machining, 3D printing.\n\nAnd let's be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century. Some nation's going to have that title. I think it's either going to be Germany or China or us. It should be us. No question it should be. We're going to fight climate change. And we're going to lead the world in fulfilling the requirements of the Paris agreement.\n\nI'm running against somebody who doesn't believe in climate change or at least he says he doesn't , who has even said he thinks it's a hoax created by the Chinese. Well, right now the Chinese have twice as much renewable energy as we do. So maybe they think it's a hoax, but they're investing. And they're creating. And they're going to want to export. And what a shame it would be. We have innovated. We have made the technology that could bring us into the forefront of this. And we're going to do it.\n\nWhen I am president, I want all of you who care about science, technology, engineering, mathematics, I want you to be part of it. And while we are growing the economy, we are going to make it fairer. We are going to raise the national minimum wage because no one who works full-time should be left in poverty. And don't you think it is finally time to guarantee equal pay for women's work?\n\nYou know, back in the spring, I was at a town hall in Las Vegas. And the little girl raised her hand. And I called on her. And she said to me, 'If you're elected president, does a girl president make the same as a boy president?'\n\nI said, \"Well, that's one of those jobs where they have to publish what you make.\" So we're going to have more transparency so people have more incentive to make sure that everybody is treated fairly.\n\nAnd I'll tell you something else. I want to do more to promote profit-sharing. If you help to make the profits, it shouldn't all just go to the executives and the shareholders. You should be able to share in that.\n\nNow, there's a lot we can do. And people say, 'Well, how are you going to pay for it?' Well, I'm going to go where the money is. And all the money is going to the wealthiest in our country. I have made a pledge, and you can hold me to it. I will not raise taxes on the middle class. Nobody who is working hard to get ahead should be asked to pay more in taxes when we have so many people who have done so well and are not paying their fair share.\n\nNow, Donald Trump is the poster child for this. Last night he finally admitted he hasn't paid a dime in federal income tax for years. Now, he claims that's because back in the early 1990s, he apparently lost a billion dollars running casinos. Who loses money running casinos? Really. Now, one of his supporters said, 'Well, the fact that he lost a billion dollars and that meant he didn't have to pay taxes made him a genius.' Well, I guess you do have to be a genius to lose a billion dollars in a year. But I'll tell you what. What that meant was he paid zero, zero for the military, zero for our vets, zero for Pell Grants to help a lot of you afford college and get through college.\n\nAnd then he did something that, in retrospect, seemed both odd and not very smart. He brought in Warren Buffett. He said, 'Well, everybody does this. Warren Buffett does this.'\n\nSo Warren Buffett, who, by the way, is a real billionaire, Warren Buffett, heard that, pretty hard to miss. And so he put out a statement today. And here's what he said. He said, 'I have paid federal income tax every year since 1944, when I was 13.' He said, 'I have copies of all 72 of my returns. And none uses a carryforward.' That was the gimmick Trump used to avoid paying his fair share. And then Warren Buffett ends by saying, 'Finally, I have been audited by the IRS multiple times and am currently being audited. I have no problem releasing my tax information while under audit.' 'Neither would Mr. Trump. At least he would have no legal problem in doing so.' Well, if you take a shot at Warren Buffett, you'd better be prepared.\n\nAnd in fact, Warren Buffett actually agrees with me that wealthy people ought to pay more. He says no person in his fortunate position in life should be paying a lower tax rate than people who work for him. And he has proposed what's called the Buffett rule, and I am absolutely behind that, and I've said that's one of the changes I want - so that the wealthy have to pay their fair share.\n\nNow, there was a lot about last night that was hard to believe. And so, don't. But one of the things that really struck me was he had not answer. You know, he's not usually tongue-tied, but he had no answer when confronted about the report that he's been buying cheap Chinese steel for his construction projects instead of American-made steel that supports good American jobs. Now, I know you've seen reports and you've probably seen a lot of the visuals coming out of his rallies. He's had a lot of them across Ohio. He claims to be on the side of workers. He especially likes to talk about how he supports American steelworkers. He even had the nerve - this is what kills me about him - he even had the nerve to brag about how American steel will send new skyscrapers soaring. And the whole time he was hiding the truth. Hiding the fact that he chose to buy illegally-dumped Chinese steel instead of American steel.\n\nYou know, when China illegally floods our market with steel at below-price, and people like Trump buy it, that kills jobs. It kills jobs in this state, including right here in Columbus. This May, Columbus Castings, the biggest single-site foundry in America, just seven miles from where we are tonight, filed for bankruptcy and announced that 800 workers would be laid off. Now, when I think of that and I think of the way Trump has been playing people, it really - it really gets me upset. There's no justification for it. But it fits him to a T. For all his talk about putting America first, he's made his products in at least 12 other countries. Trump's suits and ties were made in Mexico and China. They could have been made right here in Ohio. In fact, he could have made his ties three miles from the Trump Tower in New York.\n\nSo we've got to figure out how we have an economy that really does produce growth and rewards companies that do the right thing. And that for me means we need to have a tax system that rewards investment in our country, investment in workers, investment in plant and equipment, investment in research and development, and give the good guys a chance to get ahead instead of being taken advantage of by Wall Street and others.\n\nWe are going to end the cowboy culture on Wall Street and what happens in too many boardrooms. We're going to defend the tough new rules on Wall Street that President Obama got passed, the Dodd-Frank rules. Trump wants to do away with those. He also wants to do away with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, something that was designed and created by my friend Senator Elizabeth Warren to protect consumers. He wants to do away with that. And yet he claims to be on the side of working people and the middle class.\n\nWell, we're going to crack down on corporate fraud, like we've seen at Wells Fargo. We're going to crack down to make sure that Wall Street can never wreck Main Street again. And we're going to do it in part by imposing some penalties on companies that try to pick up and leave America. If they try to leave, we're going to slap an exit tax on them and make them pay back every single penny they ever got in tax benefits from anybody in America.\n\nWe're also going to end the carried interest loophole. I've been trying to get that done for years. We're going to get it done. We've got a couple of different ways of doing it. I hope that Congress along with us, but if they don't, we're going to figure out a way to finally put an end to what is one of the most unfair parts of the whole tax code, hedge fund managers and others paying a lower tax rate, not for investing but just for moving money around. That's going to end. I want to reward the productive economy. I don't want to keep rewarding the financial economy. That is not the way we're going to grow new businesses, and create new opportunities and more jobs for Americans.\n\nNow, people in Ohio often ask about, 'Well, what are we going to do about trade?' Well, we're going to have smart and fair trade. That's what I love about your Senator, Sherrod Brown. He is one of the best advocates for the kind of trade deals we should have. Look. We've got to trade with the rest of the world. We're only 5 percent of the population of the world. We've got to trade with the other 95 percent. When I was Secretary of State, we really bore down on this, and we increased American exports 30 percent, and in particular, 50 percent to China, because we stood behind every American business. We helped them knock down every barrier so that they could get into those markets and sell.\n\nAnd I've gone toe-to-toe with the Chinese over trade. They have tried to slap unfair tariffs and prevent American companies from doing business without having to pay some kind of big fine or make some big deal. So we're going to stand up. I'm going to have a trade prosecutor who will report directly to me to make sure every trade deal we're already in is absolutely followed to the letter so nobody takes advantage of us.\n\nAnd I've always had three tests for trade deals: Does it create American jobs? Does it raise American incomes? is it good for our national security? And when it comes to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the TPP, it fails my tests. Once it was finally negotiated, I don't think it will do what I want it to do, so I oppose it. I oppose TPP now. I'll oppose it after the election. I'll oppose it as president. But I'm going to keep fighting to open markets so that we can get more jobs and rising incomes by exporting into those markets and doing business with the rest of the world.\n\nI also saw a sign or a t-shirt out here about Social Security. And that may not always be something that people on a great university campus think about, but I'll tell you what. I am never going to let anybody privatize Social Security. That is off the table forever.\n\nSo let's say yes to good jobs, but here's what else we need to say yes to. Let's say yes to good education from preschool all the way through college and university. I want every kid to be able to attend this great university to do well. And for a lot of kids, they're not prepared when they get to kindergarten and first grade. There's an achievement gap already. There's also a digital gap; we have five million homes, mostly poor homes, without access to the internet, so they're behind. I want this to be a true meritocracy. I'm tired of inequality. I want people to feel like they can get ahead if they work for it.\n\nSo I want to have universal pre-kindergarten so every child can be prepared to be successful. I want good schools and good teachers in every zip code so every child has the best possible public education. And I think we made a mistake when we took what used to be called vocational education out of high school. We need technical education for more young people. Not everybody needs to or wants to go to a four-year college, but everybody should have the opportunity to get the skills that he or she needs to get ahead and be successful. I want us to have our community colleges working with our high schools and our businesses. We have a lot of job openings for machinists and tool and die markers, for coders, for all kinds of skills.\n\nAnd then when it comes to college, I want everybody who goes to a public college or university to understand what I am proposing that is a joint proposal from Senator Sanders and myself. We both remember that college was affordable. And it isn't for a lot of people now, and a lot of states have disinvested in their great public colleges and universities. So here is our proposal.\n\nWe want anyone from a family that makes less than $125,000 a year to go to Ohio State University tuition-free. And for families over that line, we want you to go debt-free. So yes, you pay what you can afford, but you don't have to go into debt to go to Ohio State. And I'll tell you, the other big problem - how many of you already have student debt? Oh, wow. Practically every hand. Well, here's what we're going to do. We're going to make it possible for you to refinance that debt. If you can refinance your home mortgage, your car payment, or if Donald can refinance his airplane, you ought to be able to refinance your student debt.\n\nAnd then we want you to pay it back as a percentage of the income you make, and have a limit on that, 10 percent, so that - I feel personally about this because that's what I did after law school. My dad was a small businessman, and he really was a saver. He didn't even have a credit card. Didn't believe in that. So he saved the money for me to go to college. I had to work if I wanted to buy a book, but that was okay. That was the arrangement. And then I told him I wanted to go to law school. He said, 'You're on your own. I don't have any money for that.' So I worked, I got a small scholarship, and I took out loans. But boy, was I lucky, because I got into one of the earliest income repayment programs. In other words, when I got out of law school, I could go to work for the Children's Defense Fund and make, I don't know, $14,000 a year because I could pay it back as a percentage of my income, not on an interest rate of 8, 10, 12 percent like I see from young people across America.\n\nSo that's what I want, but I also want to make it possible, if you do public service or national service, to have a lot of your loan, and maybe all of it, forgiven because you're going to be paying back to our country. And I've got this idea about something I'm calling the National Service Reserve. It's kind of like if any of you have ever been in the military reserve. You get the training and you're kind of on call and you practice and train. And then if you're needed, you're called up. I want a civilian national reserve, and I want people of all ages in it. And we would train you so that if there's a natural disaster or some other problem that has to be dealt with, we could call you up to go do that. And it's a way of making sure that people are giving back all the time to this country because that's how we build solidarity. That's how we get to know each other better.\n\nSo I'm pretty excited about what we're going to do together. And I can't do any of this without your help. I really am asking you to do everything you can to make sure you're registered, to tell your friends and anybody else you can talk to make sure they're registered. As I said, go to iwillvote.com. You can find it out right there on that site. And we'd love to have you be involved in the campaign because I know that if we win in November, we can summon the positive spirit of our country back again. I think I have to do everything, everything in my power to bring people together, and I will.\n\nIt's really important to me that you know that I want to be your president whether you vote for me or not. Obviously, I hope you do, but I will be your president, and I will stand up for you, and I will work for you, and I will fight for you. So please, if you're not registered, get registered by tomorrow, and then you can start voting October 12th. And whatever issue, whatever issue you care about, imagine that that is on the ballot. Imagine if you believe the minimum wage should be a living wage, if you believe - if you believe that we finally should have paid family leave in this country like every other advanced economy, if you believe climate change is real and we could save our planet by creating a lot of jobs at the same time, if you believe diversity is America's strength, not a weakness, if you believe women should be able to make our own health care decisions and that LGBT Americans should be treated equally across America, and you should be able to live up to your potential, no matter who you are or where you come from, then start voting October the 12th!\n\nAnd I promise you this. Together we're going to prove that we can make the future what it should be for all of you; that there is a positive, optimistic, confident America out there; that America's best days are ahead of us, not the dark and divisive vision of my opponent, but one in keeping with what I see as I travel across America - the energy, the dynamism, the entrepreneurial spirit of all Americans, but particularly young Americans. So please, join this campaign. Be part of it for the next 29 days. And together we will prove that we can have the future that we want and that yes, love trumps hate! Thank you, Ohio State!\u0000","13":"Hello, Miami Dade College! It is so great to be here with all of you.\nAnd I want to thank everyone for gathering and in particular, I want to thank all of the elected officials. Thanks to Congressman Patrick Murphy who I hope is the next senator from Florida. Thanks to Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Thank you to Mayor Phillip Levine of Miami Beach. Thanks to Mayor Phillip Stoddard of South Miami. Thanks to all the others who were part of the program. As we were coming in, we heard lots of energy coming from this crowd, and I was told as I was coming out, there's an overflow, but they can hear us in the overflow, and we're so happy you're here as well! So thanks to the overflow crowd. But what I am most excited about is to be here with one of the world's most foremost leaders on climate change: Al Gore.\n\nAbout a decade ago, Al made a movie called 'An Inconvenient Truth.' Now, maybe some of you have seen it, but if you haven't, I hope you'll watch it tonight. It doesn't have a lot of special effects - but it does have a lot of drama.\n\nAnd here's the main message: climate change is real, it's urgent, and America can take the lead in the world in addressing it. Right? We here in America can develop new clean energy solutions. We can transform our economy. We can rally the world to cut carbon pollution. And above all, we can fulfill our moral obligation to protect our planet for our children and our grandchildren.\n\nNow, let me just say - so, so let's remember, let's remember what's at stake. I'm running against a guy who denies science, denies climate change, claims it's a hoax created by the Chinese. So this is something that Al Gore's been working on for a really long time. And I want you to know how far back he goes. It was in 1982 when he held the very first hearing on climate change in the House of Representatives with the world-famous climate scientist Jim Hansen. And then when Al became a senator, he continued to raise the alarm and look for solutions, and as vice president, he led America's efforts to negotiate the Kyoto Protocol to cut greenhouse gas emissions. You take all this together, those 30 years of leadership led Al Gore to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007.\n\nI was very proud because he had been determined and persistent, and in the face of a lot of people - in public life, in business, in elsewhere who were trying to diminish the importance of the science - he never wavered. And in the years since, the climate challenge has only grown more stark. And I will tell you this, it is one of the most important issues at stake in this election.\n\nLook at it this way. Our next president will either step up our efforts to address climate change, to protect our planet, to protect our health, and to create good jobs that cannot be outsourced by growing our clean energy economy. Or in the alternative, we will be dragged backwards and our whole future will be put at risk.\n\nSo we've really got to get this right. And if you need additional convincing, just remember what happened this week. Hurricane Matthew killed at least 26 people in our country, more than a thousand as far as we know right now in Haiti. North Carolina is still dealing with serious flooding and will be at least for the rest of the week, if not longer. We all need to support each other as our communities put the pieces back together and begin the long road back from this disaster.\n\nThat's why I've encouraged everyone to give what you can afford to the Florida Disaster Fund or to Team Rubicon, the veterans organization working to respond to Hurricane Matthew, or to UNICEF, helping children and families on the ground in Haiti.\n\nNow, some will say, 'We've always had hurricanes. They've always been destructive.' And that's true. But Hurricane Matthew was likely more destructive because of climate change. Right now, the ocean is at or near record-high temperatures - and that contributed to the torrential rainfall and the flash flooding that we saw in the Carolinas. Sea levels have already risen about a foot - one foot - in much of the Southeast, which means that Matthew's storm surge was higher and the flooding was more severe.\n\nPlus, as you know, the impact of climate change goes beyond extreme events like hurricanes. It's become a daily reality here in Miami. You have streets in Miami Beach and in Shorecrest that are flooding at high tide. The ocean is bubbling up through the sewer system. Sometimes, people call 311 because they assume a water main must have broken when actually it is the sea rising around them.\n\nSo, if you need proof that climate change is real and that it's costly, there you go. So at this rate, at this rate, my friends, my friends, please. Let's focus on what's really important in this election and in your future and the future of our country, because this is what I want you to hear and understand. At the rate we are going, one in eight homes in Florida could be underwater by the end of the century, and when kids - like that adorable young boy over there on his dad's shoulders - are grandparents, we believe that's more than $400 billion worth of property in Florida at risk, and nationwide, it's as much as $882 billion in property at risk.\n\nBut there's also health consequences. Mosquitoes that carry diseases like the Zika virus and ticks that carry Lyme disease are expanding their ranges. And hotter summers and longer pollen seasons are making allergies and asthma worse, which is especially bad for our children. And look at what is happening in California, a brutal five-year drought. Wildfires have burned more than 9 million acres in our country last year.\n\nAnd it's also about national security. The Pentagon has identified climate change as a threat to our America's national security. The U.S. Atlantic Fleet is based in Norfolk, Virginia. It's the largest naval installation in the world. And because of rising sea level, the base is frequently flooded, even when it's sunny. So that's why the Pentagon is looking at how climate change will affect readiness and operations, not just in Norfolk, but at all of our military bases around the world.\n\nSo you would think if you look at the facts, if you listen to the science, that even the most committed climate skeptic would say, 'Ok, I agree, something's happening here. We need to take it seriously.'\n\nBut unfortunately, there are still plenty of people - in Washington, on the campaign trail - who won't face what's happening right in front of us.\n\nDonald Trump, is, quote, 'not a big believer' in climate change. As I said, he said it's a hoax created by the Chinese. And in our first debate two weeks ago, he tried to deny saying that. But that tweet is still there for everyone to see.\n\nAnd I would wish that Donald would actually listen to people here in Florida, like Miami Beach's Mayor Philip Levine and others who are doing incredible work to address these 'Sunny Day' Floods. Or maybe, he would listen to Miami Beach Commissioner John Elizabeth Alemon. Or maybe he would listen to Miami Beach Commissioner, John Elizabeth Alemon. John Elizabeth is a Republican, but she's supporting our campaign--because she knows America can't afford a candidate who doesn't accept climate science. Or maybe Donald would listen to our military leaders who say climate change threatens our national security, or what about the ranchers in Colorado, or the mayors in Arizona or the community leaders in Alaska who say, 'Our lives and jobs and families are being affected - please, let's come together as a country and do something about it.'\n\nWe cannot risk putting a climate denier in the White House. At all, that is absolutely unacceptable.\n\nWe need a president who believes in science and who has a plan to lead America in facing this threat, creating good jobs, and yes, saving our planet.\n\nSo here's what I want to do.\n\nFirst, we need to do a lot more on clean energy. The clean energy superpower of the 21st century is probably going to be either Germany, China, or us--and I want it to be us. And I want you to be part of making it us.\n\nAnd we need to accelerate the transition to a clean energy economy and create high paying jobs, building and installing more solar panels and wind turbines. Modernizing our electric grid. Retrofitting buildings. Building resilient, 21st century infrastructure, and we have to make sure no community is left out or left behind--not our cities or our small towns or our remote, rural areas.\n\nNow, you wouldn't know it if you only listened to my opponent talk about how terrible everything is. He has such a dark, divisive view of America, but that doesn't tell the story about what's really going on. It's actually pretty exciting. In red states and blue states, local leaders are stepping up. Rural electric co-ops are investing in community solar power and you see that across America - union workers in Michigan, union workers in Michigan are getting ready to build electric Chevys in a plant powered by clean energy. Iowa, Iowa is already getting a third of its electricity from wind. Wind turbines are going up in New England and on Lake Erie. Renewable energy is already the fastest-growing source of new jobs in America. I think that is so exciting - there are nearly 2 million people already working in energy efficiency.\n\nAnd in Spartanburg, South Carolina, a project called ReGenesis is taking an old landfill and turning it into a solar farm. That landfill was a blight and a health threat, just 250 feet away from a residential neighborhood. Now, that same land will generate enough clean, renewable electricity to power 500 homes.\n\nSo this is what we can do. And I think Washington should back up and support doing more of that. As president, I want us to have 500 million solar panels installed across America by the end of my first term. And let's generate enough renewable energy to power every home in America within the decade. Let's make our buildings and factories more energy efficient and cut our oil consumption by one-third.\n\nAnd we can get there by investing in cutting edge research, to keep developing cheaper and better clean energy technologies, investing in clean energy infrastructure and advanced manufacturing, putting big partnerships together between states, cities, and rural communities.\n\nWe can do all of this and create millions of good-paying jobs as we do. So I'm hoping that these good jobs will offer security and dignity while we produce the clean energy that will power the economy of the future. The clean energy solutions are being developed right here in America. We want them manufactured in America, installed in America, and putting people to work in America.\n\nAnd while we do that, let's make sure our communities are ready for the impacts of climate change that are coming right at us. We need to invest in resilient infrastructure. Now, sometimes that will mean building a seawall; other times, let's be more creative - like in New York Harbor, where we are replanting oyster beds to form natural barriers to storm surge. Sometimes we'll overhaul an outdated sewer system to deal with flooding from heavy downpours. In Philadelphia, they're trying something else: green roofs, porous pavements, curbside gardens to help absorb storm water.\n\nAnd here's something we don't talk enough about. Let's make sure our hospitals can stay open and operational in any kind of disaster. Because sadly, I saw what happened in New York during Hurricane Sandy, newborns who had been on respirators had to be evacuated down nine flights of stairs in one New York hospital, because the electricity went off. Nurses, I love nurses - heroic, courageous nurses were carrying those babies and manually squeezing bags of air to keep them breathing. Now, here in Miami, you know how important this is. You have retrofitted the Nicklaus Children's Hospital with a hurricane-resistant shell for exactly this reason. And every hospital in the country should follow your lead and build in more resilience.\n\nAnd then finally, we have got to lead the world to confront the climate challenge. If we don't do it, nobody will do it. We must confront the climate challenge. There's no doubt about that. And so, let's move on with the kind of leadership that the world as well as our country deserves.\n\nWhen I was Secretary of State, I worked with President Obama to make climate change a top diplomatic priority. We fought to get China and India and other major polluters to agree for the first time in history to be part of the solution. In fact, we had to crash a secret meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark - slip past the guards - it was all very cloak and dagger. But for a really important purpose, and because of that breakthrough, and a lot of patient, persistent work, and because of American leadership, 195 nations signed on to a global agreement last December. It's called the Paris Agreement. And I am not exaggerating when I say it is our last, best chance to solve the global, climate crisis.\n\nAnd what does Donald Trump want to do? He wants to cancel the Paris Agreement. He doesn't care what it would do to the planet. He doesn't care how much that would damage American leadership in the world. He doesn't care what it would do to the future we leave our kids and our grandkids.\n\nWell, he may not care - but we do. And that's why this election is so critically important because on the ballot, it is not just my name. It's every issue we care about it's our values as a country.\n\nClimate change needs to be a voting issue. We need to elect people up and down the ballot, at every level of government, who take it seriously and are willing to roll up their sleeves and get something done. Please, we cannot keep sending climate deniers and defeatists to Congress or to state houses--and certainly not to the White House.\n\nAnd if you care about climate, your Senate race is also really important, and I'll tell you why. It is unacceptable, it is an unacceptable response for Marco Rubio, when asked about climate change to say, 'I'm not a scientist.' Well, why doesn't he ask a scientist and then maybe then he'd understand why it is so important that he, representing Florida, be committed to climate change? That's why I hope that you'll elect Patrick Murphy to the United States Senate.\n\nLook, we need leaders who can get results. It's easy to stonewall. It's not enough to protest: we need creativity, we need hard work. And when it comes to climate change, we don't have a minute to waste.\n\nSo, I know it's easy to get cynical--especially about our politics. I get that. But this election matters more than any has in a really long time, and I believe that as strongly as I can, we've got to address this issue for our sakes, our children, our grandchildren. And it's so critically important when you think about how leadership can make a difference.\n\nAnd just look, if you will - look at the difference between your state, the Sunshine State, which has less solar energy than New Jersey has right now. And do you know why? Because you have a governor who has ordered the state government never to use the words 'climate change.' So my friends, this is a big deal in the election, and it is going to be a big deal for our country and our world. And there isn't anybody - there isn't anybody who knows more, has done more, has worked harder. I know he was in Miami just last year, training and educating people to be climate change activists. I can't wait to have Al Gore advising me when I am President of the United States. So please join me in welcoming our former vice president, a climate change leader and an all-around great guy, Al Gore.\u0000","14":"On November 8th, we are going to declare our independence from special interests, corrupt politicians, and from a rigged system that benefits only the insiders.\nWe are going to declare our independence from media executives that don't care about us, and politicians who don't listen to us.\n\nWe are going to declare our independence from rising crime, soaring poverty and crushing debt.\n\nWe are going to declare our independence from failures of the past and create a New American Future.\n\nOnce again, we will have a government of, by, and for the people.\n\nAmericanism, not globalism, will be our credo.\n\nIt's going to be America First from now on.\n\nLet me tell you what this new future looks like.\n\nWe are going to cut taxes and create millions of new jobs.\n\nWe are going to repeal and replace Obamacare.\n\nWe are going to appoint judges who will support, defend and uphold the Constitution of the United States.\n\nWe are going to save and cherish the 2nd amendment.\n\nWe will ensure every Veteran in this country has the right to seek medical treatment at a VA facility, or with the private doctor of their choice.\n\nWe're going to eliminate job-killing regulations.\n\nWe are going to unleash an American Energy Revolution.\n\nLet's talk about another issue that is important to our future, and the future of our children.\n\nThat's the issue of crime. Violent crime is rising across the country. More than 2,700 have been shot in Chicago alone this year.\n\nNo American should consider this level of crime acceptable. Every American has the right to live in safety and peace.\n\nA Trump Administration is going to restore law and order.\n\nLet me take this opportunity to thank our wonderful police and law enforcement officers. This state has known unbelievable heartache in recent days after the murder of 5 police officers, and the wounding of another 7, in the assault on Dallas. We pray for the families, and hope for the speedy recovery of the wounded.\n\nTo all law enforcement in America: we are with you, we support you, and we will always stand with you.\n\nTogether, we will create a safe community for every citizen in the land - but especially those who have not known safety in a very, very long time.\n\nThat includes appointing an Attorney General and a Secretary of Homeland Security who are completely committed to upholding the law.\n\nI will appoint federal officials and investigators who will work hand-in-hand with police and citizens to dismantle gangs, cartels and criminal syndicates terrorizing our people.\n\nI will appoint prosecutors who will go into the most dangerous communities in America and work to liberate our citizens from violence and fear.\n\nAll citizens deserve to be protected. No American left behind.\n\nI want every African-American parent in this country - and all parents in this country - to be able to raise their kids in safety.\n\nAnd I want to ensure every African-American child in this country - and all children in this country - are put on the American ladder of success: a good education, and a good-paying job.\n\nWe are going to have school choice, charter schools, and merit-pay for teachers. My opponent, Hillary Clinton, discriminates against African-American students by opposing school choice because she is owned and paid for by the education bureaucracy.\n\nNo one owns me. I answer only to the American people.\n\nIn a New York Post column, Deroy Murdock, published data confirming what I've been saying about the devastating economic conditions in the African-American communities. Murdock confirms these facts:\n\n\"The overall labor force participation rate for black Americans has slipped from 63.2 percent to 61.2 percent -- down 3.2 percent.\n\nThis metric also slumped for black teenagers, from 29.6 percent to 27.7 percent -- down 6.4 percent.\n\nThe percentage of black Americans in poverty has grown under Obama, the Census Bureau reports, from 25.8 percent in 2009 to 26.2 percent in 2014 -- up 1.6 percent.\n\nThe number of blacks on Food Stamps soared under Obama -- from 7.4 million in 2009 to 11.7 million in 2014 -- up 58.2 percent.\n\nAlso, from Obama's arrival through last June 30, the percentage of black Americans who own homes plunged from 46.1 to 41.7 percent, the Census reports -- down 9.5 percent.\"\n\nNearly 4 in 10 African American children live in poverty. 58 percent of young African Americans are not employed.\n\nHomicide is up nearly 50 percent in Washington D.C. and up more than 60 percent in Baltimore. Violent crime rose 17 percent in the fifty largest US cities.\n\nThis is the legacy of President Obama and Hillary Clinton.\n\nTo those suffering I say: what do you have to lose by trying something new?\n\nLet me also tell you what you have to gain: more jobs, higher wages, and a massive reduction in the terrible crime plaguing our inner cities.\n\nWe are going to turn it all around. Success must be created for everyone, and available to everyone.\n\nThat is how we are going to create a New American Future.\n\nBut to make every American safe and prosperous, we must address one of the most vital issues of all: Border Security.\n\nWe are going to build a wall.\n\nWe are going to enforce the law.\n\nWe are going to protect your jobs and wages.\n\nAnd we are going to keep our country safe.\n\nAccording to the Texas government, nearly two hundred thousand illegal immigrants were booked into Texas jails between 2011 and 2016. Collectively, those arrested were responsible for more than half a million criminal offenses, including 1,055 homicides, 5,516 sexual assault charges and more than 50,000 charges of either burglary or theft.\n\nYet, Hillary Clinton wants a totally, completely open border.\n\nShe wants catch-and-release.\n\nObamacare for illegal immigrants.\n\nMassive amnesty in her first 100 days.\n\nShe wants to gut immigration enforcement.\n\nShe supports Sanctuary Cities.\n\nShe wants to let people overstay their visas without removal.\n\nOne lawless order after another.\n\nWe must not let it happen.\n\nHillary Clinton also wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees. There have been hundreds of immigrants and their children charged with terrorism inside the United States since 9\/11, and a number of terrible attacks like the Boston Bombing, San Bernardino and Orlando. Yet Hillary Clinton wants to fling open the floodgates even wider.\n\nI want to create safe zones in the Middle East. My plan suspends visas when we can't perform effective screening, and it puts forward a new ideological screening program to keep out people from our country who don't support our values. After all, that is what taking the oath of citizenship is all about.\n\nThis election will decide whether or not we have a border.\n\nThis election will decide whether or not we have a country.\n\nToday I met with the moms of American children killed by illegal immigrants as a result of the policies Hillary Clinton supports. Hillary Clinton will never meet with these families, she will never hear these stories.\n\nThese are all forgotten Americans - they are not Hollywood or media stars, or big money special interest donors.\n\nShe is bought-and-paid-for by the special interests.\n\nThis corruption relates closely to another corruption scandal that strikes at the heart of our Democracy. Every day more and more alarming facts come out.\n\nThe scandal I speak of is the State Department's Pay-For-Play Scandal under Hillary Clinton.\n\nIf our Secretary of State can be bought, or bribed, or sell or trade government favors, then the whole American system is threatened.\n\nIt is a threat to the foundation of Democracy itself. This is what happens in a Third World country - it's the failed conditions people flee when they come to America.\n\nAmerica can never elect a candidate who, like Hillary Clinton, did government favors for those giving her family and her foundation massive amounts of cash.\n\nThe new revelations about Hillary Clinton's email scandal make clear we have only seen the tip of the iceberg.\n\nHillary Clinton is desperate to cover-up her crimes. That's why she deleted 33,000 emails. That's also why she lied repeatedly to Congress and the American public.\n\nShe said she never sent or received classified materials.\n\nThat was a lie, proved over and over again.\n\nShe claimed she used an insecure email server for the convenience of using only one device. But she used multiple devices.\n\nAnother lie.\n\nUnder penalty of perjury, she said she turned over all of her work-related emails. But the FBI found thousands she never turned over, and now just found another 15,000 more.\n\nAnother Clinton lie.\n\nShe said she sent nothing marked classified.\n\nA total lie, unmasked to the world. And more to come.\n\nShe said her server was secure, and had no breaches. But we know now it was completely unsecure, and the FBI Director said it could easily be hacked by our foreign enemies.\n\nMore Clinton lies.\n\nClinton said her lawyers reviewed all of her emails before destroying them.\n\nOne more Hillary Clinton lie.\n\nLie after lie after lie.\n\nHillary Clinton is unfit to hold public office.\n\nIt is impossible to figure out where the Clinton Foundation ends and the State Department begins. It is now abundantly clear that the Clintons' set up a business to profit from public office. They sold access and specific actions by and to them for money.\n\nIt goes back to the Arkansas days, and it continued during the White House days with the sale of the Lincoln Bedroom to large donors.\n\nBut once Bill was out of office the small time Clinton business - or, more accurately, their crime enterprise - grew with the roles reversed. Bill, now an ex-President collected the money for the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton had the public offices to sell; Senator, Secretary of State and for all that time a potential President. They turned this into an exponentially larger business.\n\nBut it was more than a business, it was a continuing big time criminal enterprise. It involved numerous violations of the conflict of interest and bribery laws and other serious laws of the United States.\n\nThe e-mails and phone logs show that the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Department of State were one and the same. If you donated to the Clinton Foundation or paid massive speaking fees to Bill Clinton, you got an entry to the Department of State. Together they constituted the most scandalous and certainly most profitable sale of public office since the Teapot Dome Scandal of the 1920s.\n\nToday a phone log was released for Cheryl Mills. She was Secretary of State Clinton's Chief of Staff. You would expect the log to contain only calls concerning Department of State business. But Cheryl Mills received 148 messages between 2010 and 2012 from the Chief Operating Officer of the Clinton Foundation - no other individual or group appears to have left that many messages.\n\nWe also just learned today that more than half the people who met with Hillary Clinton from outside government while she was Secretary of State were donors to the Foundation.\n\nThis creates the nexus which is at the core of a RICO case. In other words, they merged the two into the Clinton Family racketeering enterprise.\n\nThe specific crimes committed to carry out that enterprise are too numerous to cover in this speech. I walked through two of them yesterday - the sale of U.S. Uranium to Russia, and the exemption of a telecom giant from sanctions after they paid Bill Clinton for a speech.\n\nThe UBS saga is another one. Shortly after Hillary Clinton became Secretary of State she went to Geneva and intervened in a dispute concerning secret identities of Americans.\n\nShe negotiated a very good deal for UBS and a very bad deal for law enforcement. Of the 52,000 accounts the U.S. was seeking, the government settled for only 4,450 accounts. Her intervention was described by Treasury as unusual.\n\nBefore her unusual intervention UBS had donated only $60,000 to the Foundation. After the Clinton favor for UBS, it opened its wallet for big bucks and out came a $600,000 contribution, a $32 million loan and a $1.5 million speaking fee for Bill Clinton.\n\nThis is corruption, pure and simple.\n\nThis is why I have called for a special prosecutor.\n\nJustice is supposed to be blind. It's never supposed to be for sale.\n\nIn the long-run, there is only one way to end the corruption in our country: elect Donald J. Trump.\n\nHillary Clinton thinks she is above the law. Come November, the American people will show her that she is not.\n\nYou will be voting for justice, fairness and equality.\n\nYou will also be voting for a more inclusive country, where no one is left out.\n\nAnother 2 million Latinos have joined the ranks of those in poverty. Incomes for Latino households have declined by nearly $1,000 under President Obama. The number of Latino children living in poverty increased by 15 percent.\n\nOur pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-family agenda is going to bring hope back to every community in our nation. I will dedicate myself to restore the ladder of success to all those who live in poverty.\n\nWe reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton, who sees communities of color only as votes, not as human beings worthy of a better future.\n\nThe era of division is coming to end. We will create a new future of American unity.\n\nAre you ready for real American change?\n\nIt is time to emphasize what we all have in common as Americans.\n\nWe will promote our common culture, values and principles.\n\nWe will be one nation.\n\nWe will be one people.\n\nWe will share together one great future.\n\nIt's going to be America First.\n\nTogether, we will make America proud again.\n\nWe will make America prosperous again.\n\nWe will make America safe again.\n\nFriends, citizens and fellow Americans: We will make America great again.\u0000","15":"Thank you very much.

And boy, I'll tell you.\n\nBut even more importantly, he's a brilliant physician and I hope he will be very much involved with my administration in the coming years. \n\nThank you.\n\nI'd also like to recognize the distinguished members of Congress in attendance who have all been at the forefront of health care, and have been so helpful to me: Congresswoman Ellmers, Lummis; Congressmen Price, Harris, Burgess and DesJarlais. \n\nAnd let me give a special thanks to Senator Barrasso, a terrific doctor, a Senate leader, who did incredible work chairing our platform committee, just unbelievable work. So I want to thank you very much, Senator. Fantastic job. \n\nAnd been very, very loyal to what we're doing and what we represent. So thank you, Senator. When we win on November 8th......and elect a Republican Congress, we will be able to immediately repeal and replace Obamacare. Have to do it. \n\nI will ask Congress to convene a special session so we can repeal and replace and it will be such an honor for me, for you and for everybody in this country because Obamacare has to be replaced. And we will do it and we will do it very, very quickly. It is a catastrophe. The president said if you like your plan, you can keep your plan. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.\n\nWhich may go down as one of the great political lies of the century. Even the skeptical Democrats believed him and approved the legislation. There were Democrats that were very much against it, but they believed him and they approved it. No one ever read, or certainly very few people, the 2,700 page bill. To this day, nobody understands it.\n\nThe Obama administration has just announced massive double digit and triple digit Obamacare premium hikes everywhere, all throughout the country. Here in Pennsylvania, premiums are going to increase more than 60 percent and that's nothing compared to what will happen in the future. Of course, in the future, I'm president, there won't be Obamacare, so you won't have to worry about it. \n\nThat means parents won't have enough money to pay their bills or get medicine for their kids. In the great state of Arizona, a wonderful place I just left, premiums will go up even higher than 116 percent. Other states are going up more than 60, 70, 80, 90 percent. Deductibles can go to $12,000, $13,000, $14,000, even $15,000. In other words, your health care won't even be usable. You're paying all this money, you won't even get to use it.\n\nPeople all across the country are devastated. In many instances, their health care costs are more than their mortgage costs or their rent which, by the way, is a first in American history. This is particularly unfair to millennials and younger Americans generally who will be totally crushed by these massive health care costs before they even get started on their journey through life.\n\nOne-third of the counties -- think of this, one-third of the counties in Pennsylvania will have only a single insurance company left if you have that. That includes Philadelphia, where I went to school. The Associated Press found that some of the 440,000 Pennsylvania consumers who buy insurance through healthcare.gov will face some of the highest premium increases in the nation. The people of Philadelphia. Insurers are leaving, premiums are soaring, doctors are quitting, companies are fleeing and deductibles go through the roof. Workers' hours are being cut, hiring is frozen -- totally frozen -- and wages are being slashed. Obamacare means higher prices, fewer choices and lower quality. Yet Hillary Clinton wants to expand Obamacare and make it even more expensive. She wants to put the government totally in charge of health care in America. If we don't repeal and replace Obamacare, we will destroy American health care forever.\n\nIt's one of the single most important reasons why we must win on November 8th, we must win. \n\nThank you. \n\nThank you.\n\nThank you very much, everybody. Thank you.\n\nOur replacement plan includes health savings accounts, a nationwide insurance market where you can purchase across state lines and letting states manage Medicaid dollars so much better. We will create quality, reliable, affordable health care in a free market where parents can make the health care decisions that they really wanna make for their families. It will be a much better health care at a much less expensive cost.\n\nWe've also outlined detailed solutions on so many other issues to make life better for every American family. And while this is really -- thank you. \n\nWhile this is really a meeting and that's what it is, it's a meeting of very, very special people and I appreciate you all being here. But it's a meeting talking about health care and Obamacare. Our plan for other things also include the bringing back of manufacturing jobs. We have to do it.  We're gonna bring back your manufacturing, we're gonna bring back our jobs that formed the backbone of the American middle class and our country as a whole\n\nOur jobs are being stolen. Pennsylvania has lost almost 40 percent of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton. The city of Philadelphia has lost more than one-third of its manufacturing jobs since China joined the Word Trade Organization, another Bill and Hillary-backed disaster.\n\nA Trump administration will renegotiate NAFTA, believe me. And we have the greatest negotiators in the world. We will use our great negotiators. \n\nWe'll have a fair deal, but we'll have a deal that goes in two directions, not one direction, right into Mexico and these other places. \n\nAnd stand up to foreign product dumping, currency manipulation and unfair subsidy behavior. \n\nWe are going to bring manufacturing jobs, lots of jobs, back to Pennsylvania. We're gonna do it. And it won't even be difficult. \n\nWe're going to open modern mines and take care of our great miners. Our miners have been mistreated horribly. \n\nWe will be producing clean coal, oil, natural gas and shale energy. \n\nWe're also bringing back our steel workers who have been so badly hurt, so badly hurt. \n\nWhose jobs have been stolen by the dumping of steel all over the state, and frankly, all over this country, by China and other countries. Nobody has been treated worse than these workers, but that will change on January 20th of next year, believe me. It will change. \n\nWe're also going to provide the children of the state with school choice. So important. \n\nThat means parents can spend and take care of their children, but they can send their kids to public school, to private, to chartered, to magnet, to religious or to home school. It's going to be their right and it's going to be something that's so, so good for your children and for the education of your children. \n\nWe will also totally eliminate Common Core and bring education local. We're gonna bring it local. \n\nPeople do not like Common Core in this country, that I can tell you. \n\nAnd our system is failing, so it's obviously not working. We're gonna eliminate Common Core, we're gonna bring it local.\n\nOur tax plan will provide a 35 percent tax cut to middle class families with two kids. As an example, you have two kids, a 35 percent cut so desperately needed. Our middle class has not been properly respected, that I can tell you. \n\nWe will let parents deduct childcare expenses from their taxes and create tax-free childcare and elder care savings accounts with matching contributions for low income families. \n\nWe will eliminate the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military. When did we ever need it more? Greatest people on Earth in our military, but it's badly depleted. \n\nThank you. People love this country, don't they? Isn't it beautiful, right? Beautiful. \n\nIt's a beautiful thing to watch and see. And I see it all over the country, no matter where we go. And every time I say we are going to rebuild our depleted military, it's always the same response. It's an incredible response. \n\nOur Navy is the smallest it's been since World War I, think of that. Smallest since World War I. And rebuilding it will require a national effort. That's why I will ask my Secretary of the Navy to review facilities like the Philadelphia Navy Yard, I know it well. \n\nWith a long history of service to our Navy, proximity to vibrant private industry and room for expansion to enlist them in the rebuilding of what will be a great fleet again. \n\nTo recruit master craftsmen this buildup requires and we will establish centers of excellence at locations like the Philadelphia Navy Yard.\n\nVocational training is a great thing. We don't do it anymore. We don't do it anymore. \n\nAnd I must tell you, so often in going to college right down the road and going to college, we have people that were brilliant and we had other people that weren't as brilliant in that way but were brilliant, incredible when it came to fixing a motor, when it came to fixing something that I had no idea what was happening and other great geniuses had no idea what was happening and they could take it apart blindfolded. And we don't do that anymore. Vocational training for our country is so, so, so important. \n\nAnd just in closing -- and they loved it. They loved it. They didn't want to be doing what I was doing. They loved it. They were so good at it and they loved it. So vocational training, we're going to start it up big league. \n\nWe will rebuild our military and we will rebuild our country. I'm not a politician. My only special interest is you, the American people. That's why I've done this. \n\nThank you very much. \n\nThe guiding rule of the political class in Washington, D.C. is that they are looking out only for themselves, only for themselves with the exception of these few people. \n\nI feel guilty as I'm looking, they're staring me in the eyes. So I have to say with these exceptions. They will say anything and do anything and cling to their power and prestige at your expense. I'm running to change and reverse decades of failure and to work with the American people to create generations of success. I'm running... \n\nI'm running to restore honesty to our government and safety to our communities. We need safety. And by the way, our law enforcement officials, these are great, great people. \n\nThank you. And we are going to give great prosperity to our economy. I want to go into our poorest communities and work on a national plan of revitalization, the inner cities. \n\nAnd I've been working with so many African-American groups. These are such incredible people. We've been talking about it, working on it. We're going to bring jobs into the inner cities. We're going to bring safety. We're going to bring education, good, good schools into the inner cities. \n\nThe spirit of the people in the inner cities is beyond the spirit of anybody. And it's gonna work. It's gonna work. You watch. Americans are tired of being told to defer their dreams to another day. But politicians for the most part really mean another decade, because that's what they're talking about. Enough waiting. Time is now.\n\nBut to accomplish our goals, we must cut our ties with the small, bitter, petty politics of the past. We must declare our independence from a failed establishment that has squandered $6 trillion on foreign wars in the Middle East that never end, that we never win and that have made us far less safe. Think of it. \n\nThink of all the money that's spent, all the lives that have been lost.\n\nAnd we're far less safe today than we were before we started. They've left our borders wide open at home and shipped our jobs and wealth to other countries.\n\nIt's time for new leadership. \n\nI've led a great life and I truly love our country. So now I want to give back to the country that's been so good to me, that's why I'm doing this. \n\nAll I see everywhere I travel in this nation, and I've been everywhere, is untapped potential waiting to be realized. The people are amazing, the people are amazing. If we unlock the potential of this country and its incredible people, no dream is outside of our reach. \n\nIf we stopped believing in our failed politicians and start believing in ourselves, then anything, anything is possible. \n\nI'm asking you to dream big, to push for bold change and to believe in a movement powered by our love for each other and our love for our country. \n\nThat is how we will truly make America great again. \n\nThank you very much, thank you everybody. God bless you, thank you.\u0000","16":"Hello! Thank you! Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you so very much. Wow, what - what a wonderful welcome. It is great to be here in Fort Pierce in this beautiful theater. I love being in the Sunshine State. I really want to recognize a few people: U.S. Congresswoman Lois Frankel is here as you saw, Randy Perkins, a candidate for Congress, Kim Johnson, chair of the St. Lucie County Commission, Larry Lee Jr., state representative. Everyone, all of the elected officials, all of the students and young people, it is wonderful to be with you.\nAnd I want to thank Eileen for her introduction. We know how hard that nurses like Eileen work, and now that she is retired, she is volunteering for our campaign. This woman never quit, and Eileen, we are so glad you are on our team.\n\nI am grateful to all of the elected officials, all of the commissioners, the county commissioners, Martin County, St. Lucie, for all you do for the community, but especially for all you did this summer to clean up the algae that polluted the water, that threatened wildlife and made life hard for local residents and businesses. This is a serious and complicated problem, isn't it, for the entire Treasure Coast. And it is a reminder, if we needed it, how important good leadership is. So, I thank all the leaders for their commitment.\n\nNow, there are just 39 days between now and November 8th. Just 39 days left in the most important election in our lifetimes.\n\nWe've got to make every single day count. We have to get more people registered to vote, get more people committed to turn out to vote. We have to drive home the stakes in this election: stronger families, safer communities and an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. And underneath all of the rhetoric and the coverage and the back and forth, this campaign really comes down to two questions. What kind of future we want for ourselves, our kids and our grandkids, and how do we make it a reality?\n\nNow, as I said it the other night - how many of you saw the debate?\n\nWell as I said, I now have two grandchildren, and no offense to anybody, the two most wonderful, amazing, extraordinary. A little girl and a little boy. So I think a lot about the future. And you may have noticed that my opponent and I have different views about - well, nearly everything when it gets right down to it - not just about what makes America great, because I think America already is great - but about what we should do to make it even greater, and about that basic question about how progress happens at all.\n\nMy opponent believes in what I call a 'strongman approach.' He stood on that stage at his convention and described a hopeless, broken nation. I am sorry, I am looking at you. I don't see that. That in no way resembles the strong, vibrant America I know. And here's what he said. He said, 'I alone can fix it.' I alone?\n\nWell, we have learned that that's his way. One person getting supreme power and exercising it ruthlessly. That's why he admires dictators like Vladimir Putin so much. But that's not how change happens in America. It's never just one person, not even someone as powerful as the president. Every good our country has ever achieved has always happened because people have worked together to make it a reality. Not just the wealthy or the powerful - all of us.\n\nWe see that every day across America, and I bet many of you have been a part of it. Maybe you taught kids to read, right? Or cleaned up your local park, or the beach, maybe you have organized a cancer walk, or you have run a food drive. Whatever it is, chances are you have done something to serve your community. And by extension, your country.\n\nHow many of you - just think back over your lives - how many of you have performed some kind of service of some sort for your community, for other people. The reason I know you have is because tens and tens of millions of Americans do some kind of volunteering in your hometowns every single year. It's one of the best things about the American people. We are doers. We don't just shrug our shoulders when we see something that needs fixing, we don't get resigned or pathetic, or blame other people and turn on each other to find scapegoats. We roll up our sleeves, we get to work to try to make things better in our neighborhood, our community, our city, our state, our country.\n\nThis has been our story, the American story, since the beginning of our nation, and it is still going strong today. Now, for many Americans, including a lot of you here, serving our country has included serving in our Armed Forces.\n\nPeople are starting to call out their services!\n\nThere is no greater service or sacrifice, and we are grateful to our men and women in uniform, to their families and our veterans every single day. But what's so great is that national service can take many different forms, and it's something that I believe in so deeply, that every stage of our lives gives us the chance, from grade school through grandparenthood, to find a way to give back.\n\nWe've got folks here today from AmeriCorps, which my husband created back in 1993, and I'll tell you, to this day, it is one of his proudest achievements. Because very day, AmeriCorps volunteers are out there. They're building houses, responding to natural disasters, helping people with disabilities find jobs, find safe places to live, and next week, on October 7th, AmeriCorps will celebrate a major milestone: their one-millionth member. I'll tell you, Bill is really excited about this and so am I. And by the way, AmeriCorps has one of the best swearing in pledges I have ever heard. Here's how it starts: 'I will get things done for America.' Isn't that great? I think we should make that a national slogan.\n\nNow we also have folks here today from City Year, which is part of AmeriCorps. And every day, they're working with students who are risk of dropping out of school. They're tutoring and mentoring and running after school clubs - all to help young people really discover how capable they really are and to be empowered and to stay in school. I'm really grateful to them.\n\nWe also have people here today from the Peace Corps, which represents the best of America to the world. Peace Corps volunteers are teaching English in Kosovo, staffing health centers in Nicaragua, supporting farmers in Nepal, distributing malaria nets in Uganda. Both as First Lady and as Secretary of State, I got to see the results of their work first hand. They are making the world a healthier, more prosperous and more peaceful place. Now, maybe not all of you have been a part of one of these programs, but I know you serve in different ways.\n\nMaybe you volunteer through your school, or with your church or synagogue. Maybe you find through faith-based opportunities, as I did when I was a teenager, service opportunities. Because for many Americans, service is part of our faith. My running mate, Tim Kaine, volunteered in Honduras with Jesuits as a young man, and it changed his life. Or maybe your whole family volunteers together, Bill and Chelsea and I, every holiday season, would work at a food bank back in Arkansas. However you serve, it feels good, doesn't it? To be part of something bigger than ourselves. To take our time and labor, and put it towards something good that can happen in our country and the world.\n\nAnd you know something very interesting? Service makes us happier, it makes us healthier, and there are studies proving that. It's not just how we feel, they've actually followed people. It can also help us find our next job, or our true calling in life. It's a smart way to use our greatest asset in life, our people. And service does something important for us as a society. Too often, we Americans can become separated from each other, and I think a lot of people are feeling this way during this election.\n\nIt's easy to surround ourselves with only those that think like us, talk like us, look like us, read the same news as us, that's understandable to an extent. But it comes with a cost because it magnifies our differences, which then makes it harder to put those differences aside when our community or country needs us. There aren't many places where people of all ages, all races, all backgrounds, all beliefs come together in common cause. But service is one of them, and that's one of the reasons I think it's so valuable, because in addition to the good work it does, it helps us reconnect with each other to feel more a part of our shared American life.\n\nI believe that one of the jobs of President is to encourage more service, to help more Americans answer President Kennedy's call. You know it: Ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country.'\n\nBut sometimes it's hard to figure out. How do you make a difference, especially with everything else going on in our lives? And too often volunteering becomes something only people with lots of time and financial security can do. But that's not how it should be. Everyone should be able to contribute.\n\nSo what if we, as a country, made it easier for everybody to do that, for everybody to give back? What if we created more service opportunities for Americans of all ages, invested in programs that work and encouraged entrepreneurs to add a social component to their businesses? What if we strengthened the culture of service in America so it wasn't just something that we did one day a year, but it became a regular part of our lives. I think that would reflect our values and would tap into something so great about America.\n\nI talk a lot about how America is an exceptional nation. We're not exceptional just be-cause of the size of our military or the size of our economy. We're exceptional because of the generosity and ingenuity of our people.\n\nWay back, nearly 200 years ago, a Frenchman came to the United States, his name was Alexis de Tocqueville. He was travelling around, trying to figure out, 'What is this new place called America? They fought a revolution. Who are they?' And he saw how we had set up our government, and we had three branches, and everything that our founders really put into place. But the thing that made the biggest impression on him was our spirit of volunteerism that made a democracy as diverse and ambitious as ours possible. If I'm elected president this fall, I want to build on that strength by making a major push in support of more national service. So here's what I plan to do.\n\nFirst, let's triple AmeriCorps. That was the goal of my friend and the great Senator Ted Kennedy. It was laid out in a law named in his honor, the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act. It's finally time we get it done. Every year there are hundreds of thousands of more applications for AmeriCorps than there are spots in the program, so if we grow the program from 75,000 annual members to 250,000, we're going to give more people who already want to serve the chance to do so.\n\nThen I want to double the college scholarships that AmeriCorps members earn through their service, and I want to find ways for more students to get college credit for service because I know too many talented, committed young people who pass up serving with AmeriCorps because, with their student loans, they can't afford it. So let's lighten that burden. If you do national service, we will begin a program to forgive your loans, because you are giving back to your country. And let's keep working to the ultimate goal of making it possible for any American to serve full time if they want to.\n\nNow second, let's grow the Peace Corps. Since President Kennedy launched it 55 years ago, it's given nearly a quarter of a million Americans the experience of a lifetime, and it's fostered friendship and cooperation between Americans and people in more than 100 nations. We've got to do more of that in the world today. We need more Americans of all ages around the world showing our values, serving people. So let's make it possible for more Americans to be a part of this extraordinary program.\n\nThird, let's expand service opportunities for people of all ages. Right? Now, let's be fair, the younger generation is way ahead on this. I've talked to so many young people who are deeply thoughtful about how your lives impact others and the world. Service isn't just something to do to check a box before graduation, it really is woven into your lives. And many who are just getting started in your careers, say that having a social impact is more important to you than getting a job that yes, may pay a salary but doesn't give you any meaning or purpose in your lives.\n\nNow I also want to get older Americans more involved. Service isn't something only students and young people do. I know that. So I intend to make sure that 10 percent of AmeriCorps slots go to Americans over the age of 55. Let's give people an encore opportunity after they've ended their formal careers so they can apply a lifetime of knowledge and experience to a stronger community.\n\nAnd finally, I want to create a new means for people to serve in serious, meaningful ways without a full time commitment. AmeriCorps is a full time commitment. The Peace Corps is a full time commitment. The Armed Forces are a full time commitment. But the Armed Forces has another model. The Reserves - right? It gives people the chance to make a high impact contribution while still building careers and pursuing their dreams in other ways. So let's do something like that in the civilian space. Let's call it the National Service Reserve.\n\nAnd here's the idea. If you join the National Service Reserve, you will receive some basic training, just like you would in the military reserves, and then when your city or state needs you, you'll get the call. Say a natural disaster strikes and the Red Cross needs all hands on deck. Or maybe, like the crisis in Flint, and clean water has to be distributed every day to a lot of families. Or maybe your city launches a major public health campaign to reduce drug abuse or promote mental health. You will then be sent into action. Now some of these assignments maybe just be for a few days, a month, some might be longer term. But they will directly address a vital need in your own community.\n\nAnd one of the other advantages is you can help meet that need while still being a full-time student, having a job, taking care of your family. You won't have to make service your only priority. Our goal is 5 million people spread across all 50 states, and we will have an open door to people of all ages, but we want to put a special focus on people under 30 who've said again and again they want to have a bigger impact in their communities, but they can't leave their jobs, understandably. We'll work with governors and mayors, Republicans and Democrats, because I want this to be a true bipartisan, public-private partnership.\n\nI also want to include businesses, colleges and universities who have unique resources to offer. And because we want workers and students to know that as they make this contribution, their schools and their employers will have their backs. I really think a National Service Reserve could make a difference for cities and states. There's so much work to be done and so many people who want to help do it. So let's bridge that divide, get people working together in ways that can help communities.\n\nNow, I don't think you'll hear anything about this from my opponent. And you know what? I think that's a shame, because national service has always been a bipartisan goal. Of course, President Kennedy started the Peace Corps and my husband started AmeriCorps - but President Nixon signed the Domestic Volunteer Service Act. President George H.W. Bush created the White House Office of National Service. And both President George W. Bush and President Obama have been huge champions of service. This should be something that we all can get behind. And when you listen to what's being said in this campaign, it can be discouraging, right? It can seem hard to find any common ground so it makes it even more important that we come together where, whenever we can. Now, I am well aware that candidates don't usually focus on national service in the final stretch of a hotly fought presidential election. Some might say, 'Well hey, my gosh, you've only got 39 days to go. Why aren't you just out there beating up on your opponent and doing everything to get the vote out and all the rest of it? Well, I'll do that, but - I've been thinking about this for a long time, and I did not want this campaign to end without talking about it because it means a lot to me. I'm trying to end the campaign focusing on issues that are really close to my heart - and this is one of them.\n\nThank you!\n\nFor me, service is really all about fulfilling the instruction of my Methodist faith, and you can see part of the creed I like to follow behind me: 'Do all the good you can, in all the ways you can, in all the places you can, at all the times you can, to all the people you can, as long as ever you can.' Now, I've carried those words with me ever since I heard them as a little girl, and it's an idea that really got into my head and my heart. But you know what's kept me going are the people that I've met. And in a country founded on liberty and equality, I can't think of a more important notion than every one of us is valuable. We all deserve respect. We all should listen to each other. We all can make our mark on the world. And when we come together in common purpose, we can do so much more than we could ever do on our own.\n\nThat's why 'Stronger Together' is more than just a slogan. It's a course of action. So here's what I want to do. I want you to hear me pledge that this will be a vital aspect of my presidency. And I want you to help me bring our nation together - to solve our problems, strengthen our communities. To join with people across America who care about service, because this speaks to both what is great and good about the United States. America is great because we are good. There are lots of examples. We are going to be putting examples up on my website of people who have served and who are inspirations. But I want everybody here to know that it can be done. We can do more, and we can provide the opportunities to enlist more people.\n\nThere are so many examples in this community and communities across America - 39 days left. This is the choice: do we lift each other up, or do we tear each other down? Do we listen and respect each other, or do we scapegoat, point fingers, and insult each other? Well, I'll tell you what side I'm going to be on, and with your help, we're going to demonstrate on November 8th, what kind of country we really are.\n\nThank you and God bless you!\u0000","17":"Thank you. Thank you, Temple! I am so delighted to be here with all of you. I saw how much fun President Obama had last week and - I wanted to be here in Philadelphia.\nBefore I begin with my remarks, I do want to say how proud I am of our brave first responders working to keep us safe after the attacks of the last weekend in New York, New Jersey and Minnesota. There are now reports of a suspect in custody, but we must remain vigilant. This is a fast-moving situation and a sobering reminder that we need steady leadership in a dangerous world.\n\nI'm here to talk about a number of the issues that are part of this election but really, much more than that, they are part of our future - the kind of country we want to have, the kind of people we want to be and, particularly, what kind of opportunities we should be providing for the young people of America. I have a proud Owl on my staff, Jamira Burley. A Philadelphia native who became an activist working to end the epidemic of gun violence right here in Philadelphia. She loves Temple and we love her. And I also want to thank Lauren for that introduction.\n\nJamira and Lauren are two examples of why I do have so much faith in our future. Your generation is the most inclusive, progressive and entrepreneurial that we've ever seen. And as you heard, when Lauren was in college, she saw challenges facing students of color, but there was no NAACP chapter to support them and promote diversity and inclusion on campus - so she started one. And Lauren remains committed and engaged, working with an organization called Generation Progress, because she understands that active citizenship is a lifelong job and the call to service never fades.\n\nNow, I know that with so much negativity out there, it is really easy to get cynical - especially about our politics. I remember wrestling with that challenge when I was a student during the Vietnam War. It can be tempting to think that no one will tell you the truth and nothing's ever going to change. But you're here today because you refuse to accept cynicism. You know that the next 50 days will shape the next 50 years. And you see how much needs fixing in our country, from the soaring cost of college to the scourge of systemic racism to the threat from climate change - but you also know the only way we can meet those challenges is if we meet them together.\n\nYou're here today because you believe we can do just that. You want something to vote for, not just against. Optimism, not resentment. Answers, not anger. Ideas, not insults. Bridges, not walls. You're also here because you know this election isn't a reality TV show. It shouldn't be about birth certificates or name-calling or stunts to get onto cable news.\n\nThis election comes down to a choice between two very different visions for America. I believe it's wrong to tear each down. We should be lifting each other up. It's wrong to let income inequality get even worse. We have to make the economy work for everyone, not just those at the top. And it's wrong to put a loose cannon in charge who could start another war. We should work with our allies to keep us safe.\n\nIt comes down to this: Are we going to pit Americans against each other and deepen the divides in this country, or are we going to be, as I know we can, stronger together?\n\nI know what I believe, and I'm going to close my campaign the same way I started my career - fighting for kids and young people and families. That has been the cause of my life. And it will be the passion of my presidency, and I hope you'll join me. We can't get distracted when the media or my opponent turns this election into a circus. My husband has a saying about that. He calls it majoring in the minors - getting so wrapped up in stuff that doesn't matter, you forget what's really important to your future and to the future of this country.\n\nTake the challenges facing young Americans today. First of all, if you're willing to work hard, you should be able to find a good job that pays well and lets you do what you love and make your mark in the world. But that's been out of reach for too many young people - trying to find your footing in the wake of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. That's why Tim Kaine and I have a plan to work with both parties and make a historic investment in good new jobs. We can create millions of jobs and make life a lot better by doing things like connecting every household to broadband by 2020; installing half a billion solar panels; building a cleaner, more resilient electric grid with enough renewable energy to power every home in the country.\n\nNext, getting an education should give you a boost, not hold you back. But as you know better than most, tuition keeps going through the roof and debt keeps piling up. I understand that Temple was founded to democratize, diversify and widen the reach of higher education. That is still a vital goal.\n\nSo I worked with Bernie Sanders on a plan. We came up with a plan that makes public college tuition-free for working families and debt-free for everyone. And if you already have debt, we will help you refinance it and pay it back as a percentage of your income so you're never on the hook for more than you can afford. You can actually see how much you and your family can save under our plan by looking at the College Calculator at hillaryclinton.com.\n\nAnd here's something we don't talk about enough: a four-year degree should not be the only path to a good job in America. People should be able to learn a skill, practice a trade, and making a good living because of that. So we're offering new tax credits to encourage companies to offer paid apprenticeships that let you earn while you learn and do more to dignify skills across the board - for welders, machinists, health technicians, coders, and so many other fields.\n\nAnother challenge I hear about all the time is from new parents about how hard it is to balance the demands of work and family in today's economy. Families look different today than they did decades ago, I think we can all agree. Most need two incomes just to get by. And many people now change jobs frequently and have wildly unpredictable schedules, or they have to cobble together part-time work, all without the basic supports available to parents in nearly every other advanced country.\n\nThat's why Tim Kaine and I have a plan to help working families with quality, affordable childcare, preschool and paid family leave. We fundamentally believe - the more we can strengthen families, the stronger we will be as a nation.\n\nEverywhere I go, young people also share their concerns about the divisiveness and discrimination we see in America today. You aren't - and you shouldn't be - satisfied with the progress we've made. You should keep wanting to right wrongs and fight for justice and dignify for all. We see, as Lauren said, too many young black men and women made to feel like their lives are disposable; too many immigrants living in fear of deportation; too many young LGBT Americans bullied; too many young women and men sexually assaulted on campus or in the military or at home. And more than previous generations, you understand that all these challenges are intersecting, and we must take them on together.\n\nBut you also see a Republican nominee for president who incites hatred and violence like we've never seen before in any campaign. Hate speech being normalized. The dog whistles are out in the open. And yet, despite this, I remain convinced America's best days are ahead of us. In large part, that's because of the inspiring young people I meet every day.\n\nI'm inspired by Astrid. I met her in Las Vegas last summer. She was brought to this country from Mexico at the age of four with nothing but a doll, a cross, and the dress she was wearing. Now she's in her twenties and advocating for the rights of undocumented Americans and comprehensive immigration reform. We should all join her in this.\n\nI'm inspired by Mikey, who I met in New York. Mikey spent six months in prison for a low-level drug offense. After he got out, Mikey discovered just how hard it is for people who've done their time to find good jobs and opportunities. But he persisted, and he managed to start his own ice cream shop in New York - and I can recommend, it's delicious. We have to do more to help others get that second chance, including by banning the box and reforming our criminal justice system.\n\nI'm inspired by Erica, one of the bravest young women I've ever met. Her mother, Dawn, was the principal of Sandy Hook School who died trying to protect her students. Erica was devastated. But then, she made it her mission to advocate for commonsense gun safety reforms. It's been painful for her - a lot of hate has come her way and the gun lobby is so powerful - but Erica won't give up. As she said, 'What if everyone who faced tough odds said, it's hard, so I'm going to walk away? That's not the type of world I want to live in.'\n\nThat's the spirit that makes this country great - we might get knocked down, but we get right back up again. And we refuse to quit, no matter what. And that's the spirit we need in this election too.\n\nNow, I know that with Washington paralyzed by big money and partisanship, the gap between the change we want and the progress that politics should deliver can look like a chasm. I also know that even if you're totally opposed to Donald Trump, you may still have some questions about me. I get that. And I want to do my best to answer those questions.\n\nWhen it comes to public service, the 'service' part has always easier for me than the 'public' part. I will never be the showman my opponent is - and you know what, that's okay with me. And it's also true I do spend a lot of time on the details of policy, like the precise interest rate on your student loans, right down to the decimal. But that's because it's not a detail for you. It's a big deal. And it should be a big deal to your president.\n\nSo here's what I ask any voter who is still undecided: Give us both a fair hearing. Hold us accountable for our ideas, both of us. I can't promise you'll agree with me all the time, but I can promise you this: No one will work harder to make your life better. I will never stop, no matter how tough it gets. In fact, you can read about what Tim and I want to do. We're not keeping it a secret. We've got a book called 'Stronger Together.'\n\nBut let me tell you a little bit about the values that drive me and my vision for the future because you deserve that from anyone from anyone running for president. I want to share with you the stories of three women who at pivotal moments changed my life and set me on a course of social justice, activism, and public service.\n\nThe first woman is my mother. Her name was Dorothy, and she was abandoned by her parents as a young girl. She ended up out on her own at 14, working as a housemaid. When I learned about this many years later, I asked how she managed to grow up into a warm, loving person and not become bitter and broken. And here's what she said, one word: 'kindness.' She was saved by the kindness of others. Like the teacher who saw she had nothing to eat at lunch and brought extra food to share. The lesson she passed on to me was simple but powerful: No one gets through life alone. We have to look out for each other and lift each other up. She made sure I learned the words of one of the creeds of our Methodist faith: Do all the good you can for all the people you can in all the ways you can as long as ever you can.\n\nThat mission guides me still today. When I stumble, it helps pick me up, because there's always more good to do and more people to help if we keep our eyes open, especially kids.\n\nWhen I met a terrified little girl in Nevada who burst into tears because she worried her parents would be deported, it hit me right in the gut. I knew how hard-working her parents were. I knew the sacrifices they were making so that she could have a better life. When I met a little boy in Flint, Michigan who got sick from drinking water poisoned with lead, it just made me so angry and determined to work even harder. Every one of our children deserves the chance to share in the promise of America.\n\nThe second woman I want to tell you about is Marian Wright Edelman. She was a lawyer for the NAACP in Mississippi, first African American woman to pass the Mississippi bar. She was an ally of Dr. King and Robert Kennedy, and the founder of the Children's Defense Fund, an altogether remarkable person. One day during my first semester in law school, I saw a flyer - we used to have those, flyers on a campus bulletin board. And Marian was coming to give a lecture. I made sure to be there, and what I heard was captivating. Marian talked about creating a Head Start program in Mississippi and using her legal education to make life better for poor children and families. Something just clicked in my brain. I began to see how I could translate the commitment to helping others I'd learned from my mother, my church, into real social change. I went up to her and I said, 'Could I work for you this summer?' She said, 'Sure, but I can't pay you.' I said, 'Well, I am paying my way through law school, so I have to get paid.' She said, 'Well, if you can figure out how to get paid, you can have a job.' So I figured out how to get a grant to get paid and went to work for her.\n\nAfter graduation, I could have followed my classmates to a high-powered law firm, but I went to work for Marian at the Children's Defense Fund instead. She sent me door to door in New Bedford, Massachusetts on behalf of children with disabilities who were denied the chance to go to school back then. And I remember meeting a young girl in a wheelchair on the small back porch of her house. She told me how badly she wanted an education, but it just didn't seem possible. My heart went out to her and I wanted to help. But it became clear to me that simply caring is not enough. That wouldn't force the public school to build more wheelchair ramps or put more resources into special education. I learned that to drive real progress, you have to change both hearts and laws. So we gathered evidence. We built a coalition. And our work helped convince Congress to ensure access to education for all students with disabilities. And that experience turned me into a lifelong advocate for children and families.\n\nI went to South Carolina to investigate the plight of 12- and 13-year-old boys imprisoned alongside grown men who had committed serious felonies. In Alabama I helped expose the racism of segregated academies. In Arkansas I ran a legal aid clinic that provided representation to poor families and prison inmates who could not afford it. When Bill was elected President, a lot of people were surprised, and even threatened, by the idea of an activist as First Lady. But I wasn't about to quit then, either. I fought for universal health care, and ended up working with Republicans and Democrats in Congress to create the Children's Health Insurance Program, which covers eight million kids today.\n\nThe third woman who changed my life was named Sophia, the 17-year-old captain of a high school basketball team in New York City. It was the late 1990s, and Democrats in New York were urging me to run for the Senate, and I kept telling them no. After all, no First Lady had ever done anything like that. I myself hadn't run for anything since student council. I'd always been an advocate, not a politician. But then one day I visited that school in New York for an event with young women athletes with Billie Jean King. Hanging above our heads was a big banner that said, 'Dare to compete.' Before my speech, Sophia introduced me. She was tall, and as we shook hands, she bent over and whispered in my ear, 'Dare to compete, Mrs. Clinton. Dare to compete.' Once again, something just clicked. For years I had been telling young women to step up. Participate. Go for what you believe in. Could it be I was afraid to do something I had urge so many others to do?\n\nWell, it was a difficult transition, becoming a candidate for the first time back in that New York Senate race. Even all these years later, I confess I don't enjoy doing some of the things that come naturally to most politicians, like talking about myself. But I took that leap then for the same reason I'm running now, to even the odds for those who've got the odds stacked against them, especially children and families. And I've learned that in a democracy, if you want to help the greatest number of people, you have to push for reform from both the outside in and the inside out. We need activists and advocates, entrepreneurs and innovators, teachers and mentors, people who change lives every day in a million quiet ways. We also need strong, principled leaders who can win votes, write laws, allocate resources, and do the slow, hard business of governing.\n\nNow, of course, politics can be discouraging. This election in particularly can be down-right depressing sometimes. But it matters. It really does. It matters for our families, our communities, and our country and the world. Our most cherished values are at stake. Every election is important, from school board to state senate to president. But this time is different. We are facing a candidate with a long history of racial discrimination in his businesses, who retweets white supremacists, who led the birther movement to delegitimize our first black President, and he's still lying about it today. He refuses to apologize to President Obama, his family, and the American people. We have to stand up to this hate. We cannot let it go on.\n\nAnd when we do that, we send a clear message: America is better than this. America is better than Donald Trump. Just as important, we have a chance to make real progress together in our country. I need you. I need you as partners, not just for winning this election, but for driving real change over the next four years. The fights ahead of us are bigger than one election, one president, or even one generation. It's going to take all of us working side-by-side to build the kind of future we want. That's why, if I'm in the White House, young people will always have a seat at any table where any decision is being made.\n\nSo if you believe diversity is America's strength, not America's burden, join us. If you believe the minimum wage should be a living wage and no one working full-time should have to raise their children in poverty, join us. If you believe that climate change is real and that we can save our planet while creating millions of good-paying clean energy jobs, join us. If you believe that every man, woman, and child in America has the right to affordable, quality health care, join us. If you believe we should finally guarantee equal pay for women, join us.\n\nAnd here's how you can join us. Go to iwillvote.com and register today. Register your friends. Register everyone you know. This is going to be close. We need everyone off the sidelines. Not voting is not an option. That just plays into Trump's hands. It really does. Text 'join,' j-o-i-n, to 47246 right now, or go to hillaryclinton.com and sign up to volunteer. I understand here at Temple you're already organizing campaign tailgates at every football game and having a lot of fun doing it. We have 50 days, 50 days, to reach everybody we possibly can, to not only win an election - that's just the first step - then to keep the progress going, go even further, make it absolutely clear that we're going to shape a future that represents the best of who we are. So talk to your classmates. Talk to your neighbors. Help us stand up for our best values and reject prejudice and paranoia.\n\nYou know, I mentioned my mother and the kindness she experienced. Her life was so neglected that when she went to work as that housekeeper\/babysitter at the age of 14, it was the first time she ever saw a family that loved each other, where the parents loved their children, cared for them, planned for them, where she learned the lessons that enabled her to be such an extraordinary mother to me and my brothers. Everything I've learned in my life convinces me that love trumps hate.\n\nSo please join us in working together. There's no doubt in my mind that young people have more at stake in this election than any other age group. And when you turn out and vote this fall, we will be sending a message much larger than even the outcome. We will say we can build a future where all our children have the opportunity to live up to their God-given potential, no matter who they are, where they're from, what they look like, or who they love. That's the America we believe in. That's the America worth fighting for. That's what we've got to do to stand together. We are stronger together, and let's make sure love trumps hate. Thank you all!\u0000","18":"Thank you. That's so nice. Thank you.\nWell, that's so nice. And, Bishop Jackson, I want to thank you and Dr. Jackson and you have some voice, I have to say. Incredible. And some spirit, some spirit. Talent.\n\nThank you. Well, I just wrote this the other day knowing I'd be here. And, I mean it from the heart and I'd like to just read it and I think you'll understand it maybe better than I do in certain ways.\n\nFor centuries, the African-American church has been the conscience of our country. So true. It's from the pews and pulpits and Christian teachings of black churches all across this land that the Civil Rights movement lifted up its soul and lifted up the soul of our nation. It's from these pews that our nation has been inspired toward a better moral character, a deeper concern for mankind, and spirit of charity and unity that binds us all together. And we're bound together and I see that today. This has been an amazing day for me.\n\nThe African-American faith community has been one of God's greatest gifts to America and to its people. There is perhaps no action our leaders can take that would do more to heal our country and support our people than to provide a greater platform to the Black churches and church-goers. You do right everyday by your community and your families. You raise children in the Light of God; I will always support your church, always. And defend your right to worship . . . so important.\n\nI am here today to listen to your message and I hope that my presence here will also help your voice to reach new audiences in our country and many of these audiences desperately need your spirit and your thought. I can tell you that.\n\nChristian faith is not the past but the present and the future. Make it stronger. And we'll open it up to great, great leaders like Pastor Jackson, Bishop Jackson, Dr. Jackson, and so many others. And so many others actually sitting here. Darrell Scott, who is phenomenal, who has been with me for so long. So long. Omrosea, who is a very nice person and I don't want to say that. Because I'll destroy her image by saying that. She's actually a very, very fine person and pastor. And I want to thank all the folks and there is somebody that's been very special to me, Dr. Ben Carson who's been . . . Stand up, Ben. Come here, come here. Come here, Ben. This is a great man and great guy.\n\nSo, as I prepare to campaign all across the nation, and in every community, I will have an opportunity to lay out my plans for economic change. Which will be so good for Detroit and so good for this community because we're going to bring jobs back. I will have a chance . . . Thank you. We're bringing them back. We're taking them from Mexico and everywhere else because they're gone.\n\nI will have a chance to discuss school choice. Its very important. And how to put every American on the ladder of success. A great education, a great job. But today, I just want to let you know that I am here to listen to you and I have been doing that. And we had a fantastic interview with Bishop Jackson. It was really an amazing interview. He is better than the people who do that professionally. I will tell you. It's true. It's true. It's true. He's better.\n\nAnd I didn't really know what I was getting into. I didn't know. Is this going to be nice? Is this going to be wild? He's a great gentleman and a very smart guy. I just hope you don't lose him to Hollywood. That's the only problem. And especially, and especially Dr. Jackson, she may be gone. Hollywood is calling. Look at all those television cameras back there. Look at all the television cameras. I'm sorry to do that to you, Bishop. Because, it's just one of those things, right?\n\nOur nation is too divided. We talk past each other, not to each other and those who seek office do not do enough to step into the community and learn what is going on. They don't know. They have no clue. I'm here today to learn. So that we can together remedy injustice, in any form. And so that we can also remedy economics so that the African-American community can benefit economically through jobs and income and so many other different ways.\n\nOur political system has failed the people and works only to enrich itself. I want to reform that system so that it works for you, everyone in this room. I believe true reform can only come from outside the system. I really mean that. Being a businessman is much different than being a politician because I understand what is happening. And we are going outside the establishment.\n\nBecoming the nominee of the Party of Abraham Lincoln -- a lot of people don't realize that Abraham Lincoln, the great Abraham Lincoln was a Republican -- has been the greatest honor of my life. It is on his legacy that I hope to build the future of the Party but more important the future of the country and the community.\n\nI believe that we need a Civil Rights agenda for our time. One that ensures the rights to a great education -- so important -- and the right to live in safety and in peace and to have a really, really great job. A good paying job and one that you love going to every morning. That can happen. We need to bring our companies back.\n\nIt also means the right to have a government that protects our works and fights, really fights for our jobs. I want to help you build and rebuild Detroit. And we can do that especially with people like Bishop Jackson and Dr. Jackson. I mean that. It's been an amazing experience. It's been an amazing experience. Really.\n\nNothing is more sad than when we sideline young black men with unfulfilled potential, tremendous potential. I met some people this morning that are incredible people and they're looking for jobs. These are incredible people . . . young people. Our whole country loses out when we're unable to harness the brilliance and the energy of these folks\n\nWe're one nation and when anyone hurts, we all hurt together. That is so true. So true.\n\nWe're all brothers and sisters and we're all created by the same God. We must love each other and support each other and we are in this all together. All together.\n\nI fully understand that the African-American community has suffered from discrimination and that there are many wrongs that must still be made right and they will be right. I want America prosperous for everyone. I want to make this city the economic envy of the world and we can do that. We can do that again.\n\nFactories everywhere, new roads and bridges, new schools -- especially schools -- and new hope.\n\nI have been so greatly blessed, and in so many ways, with no greater blessing than my family. I've had a great family.\n\nNothing would make me happier and more fulfilled than to use what I have learned in business and in traveling all over the world -- I've sort of seen a lot -- to bring the wealth and prosperity and opportunity to those who have not had these opportunities before. And that's many, many people in Detroit.\n\nWhen I see wages falling, people out of work, I know the hardships this inflicts and I am determined to do something about it. I will do something about it. I do get things done, I will tell you. Some people have strengths, that's one of my strengths, I get things done. I'm going to get things done for you.\n\nPlease know this, for any who are hurting, things are going to turn around.Tomorrow will be better. Much better. The Pastor and I were talking about, riding up the street, how we see all those closed stores and people sitting down on the sidewalk, and no jobs, and no activity. We'll get it turned around. We'll get it turned around, Pastor. Believe me.\n\nWe're going to win again as a country and we're going to win again for all of our people. I want to work with you to renew the bonds of trust between citizens and the bonds of faith that make our nation strong. America has been lifted out of many of its most difficult hours through the miracle of faith and through people like Bishop Jackson and Dr. Jackson. So important. People have no idea how important they are.\n\nNow, in these hard times for our country, let us turn again to our Christian heritage to lift up the soul of our nation. I am so deeply grateful to be here today and it is my prayer that the America of tomorrow -- and I mean that -- that the America of tomorrow will be one of unity, togetherness, and peace. And perhaps we can add the word prosperity. Ok? Prosperity.\n\nI'd like to conclude with a passage from 1 John, Chapter 4. You know it? See, most groups I speak to don't know that. But we know it. If you want, we can say it together: 'No one has ever seen God, but if we love one another, God lives in us and His love is made complete in us.' And that is so true.\n\nThank you very much. This has been such an honor. Thank you very much. Bishop, thank you sir. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\u0000","19":"Thank you. Thank you very much. Oh, Jon. Jon is such a great actor and such a great person. He is such a great person. And he's really been with me a long time in a lot of different ways. He's been incredible. So I just want to thank Jon. And I hope he makes another movie very quickly, because I love his movies. \nIn particular, I wanted to thank our host, Tony Perkins, for his years of leadership.  And we know all about that. And we all express our support for Tony as he deals with the aftermath of the terrible floods in Louisiana, where two weeks ago I spent some time, and I saw some incredible, incredible people.\n\nThank you.  Amazing, amazing group.\n\nOne of the greatest privileges of my journey has been the time I've spent with the evangelical community. And the support they gave me in those primaries was absolutely incredible, I have to tell you.  All across the nation. A lot of people said: I wonder if Donald will get the evangelicals. I got the evangelicals.  I'm going to make it up to you too, you watch. There are no more decent, devoted, or selfless people than our Christians brothers and sisters here in the United States. \n\nTrue. So true. I've witnessed that incredible generosity all across this land, gotten to know so many people. I saw it during my trip to Louisiana, where Christian volunteers raced to help their fellow citizens in need. Franklin Graham is an example. He brought the most incredible people and equipment to Louisiana.  And he didn't want anything for it. He's a great man. It's that spirit of giving that we will need to rebuild Louisiana and to rebuild this country, which is in serious, serious trouble. \n\nYet, our media culture often mocks and demeans people of faith. And you understand that. All the time I hear from concerned parents how much harder it is for a Christian family to raise their children in today's media environment.\n\n\nIt is right, isn't it?  Yeah, it is right.  Not even close. Your values of love, charity and faith built this nation.  So how can it be that our media treats people of faith so poorly? One of the reasons is that our politicians have really abandoned you, to a large extent. And Hillary Clinton, you can forget about her. \n\nSo let me say this right up front: A Trump administration, our Christian heritage will be cherished, protected, defended, like you've never seen before.  Believe me. I believe it. And you believe it. And you know it. You know it. And that includes religious liberty - remember, remember.  I recently had a chance to visit a church in Detroit, Great Faith Ministries International. Stand up if you're member. That's good. That was a great - that was an amazing experience.  And the bishop, what a great guy.\n\nIn my remarks, I spoke about how African American church - and this is all across the country - for centuries have been the conscience of our nation. Their unbreakable faith and sprit overcame some of the most difficult periods in our history, leading us all to a better future. Very true. Amazing. This was such an amazing experience.  This is the power of faith. It's the power to heal. It's the power to unite. It's the power to make all of us live better lives - all of us. \n\nOur nation today is divided. Nobody likes to say it, but we're living in a very, very divided nation. It will be our faith in God and his teachings, in each other, that will lead us back to unity. \n\nEach of us here today has a role to play in bringing our country together, united in common purpose and in common values. So let's talk today about some of the things - and these are great things - that we can do together to create the American future for everybody, not just a certain group of people, but for everybody.\n\nThe first thing we have to do is give our churches their voice back. It's been taken away.  The Johnson amendment has blocked our pastors and ministers and others from speaking their minds from their own pulpits. If they want to talk about Christianity, if they want to preach, if they want to talk about politics, they're unable to do so. If they want to do it, they take a tremendous risk that they lose their tax-exempt status.\n\nAll religious leaders should be able to freely express their thoughts and feelings -  - on religious matters. And I will repeal the Johnson amendment -  - if I am elected your president, I promise.  So important.\n\nThank you. That's so important.\n\nAnd I must tell you from the heart, this started, a building of mine in Manhattan. I had 50 pastors in a big conference room. And we actually had 50 pastors, two rabbis, a couple of priests. We were all talking. And we were there for two hours. And at the end, it was a love-fest. We all agreed. It was like a love-fest.\n\nAnd I said to them - we were high up in a building on 5th Avenue - and I said to them I'd love your support. And I know when I can get support. I'm quite sophisticated.  And I know they wanted to give me their total support, 100 percent, just like I had in the primaries. And I said I really would like your support. And they didn't really know what I was talking about. And I said, what's going on here? They said, well, sir, we can't do that because we would be violating the laws. And I said, what's the punishment? Well, we could lose our tax-exempt status, which, of course, is a, you know, massive penalty.\n\nI said, tell me about this. And we sat down. They talked about it. When did it happen? 1954 or so. Lyndon Johnson was having problems - powerful guy. I actually, as just own way - you have to gain respect for what he was able to do. Can you imagine that this man single-handedly - he was having problems with churches. And there was a church in Houston that was giving him a hard time, maybe for very good reason. And he put in an amendment that basically stopped our great pastors and ministers and others from talking, under the penalty of losing their tax-exempt status.\n\nSo we were looking down onto the sidewalk and there were people walking on the sidewalk. And I said, so, folks, what you're telling me is those people walking way, way down there on the sidewalk have really more power than you do, because they're allowed to express their feelings and thoughts openly and without penalty. And one of the pastors, who I knew very well - and these are powerful people; these are strong people with magnificent voices and just - and magnificent hearts, much more importantly - they looked at me and they said, that's actually right. They have more power than we do. We're not allowed to express.\n\nAnd that's what I said. We have to start thinking about this. And I thought about it. And then we had a large group of pastors again. I said I have thought about it. If I become president, we are going to knock out the Johnson amendment. We are going to do that. And it's not going to be hard. It's not going to be hard. \n\nWhen you - when you think, from the standpoint of political, you have more than men - let's say men are 50 percent, women are 50 percent. You're much more than 50 percent, added together. And I actually believe that's one of the reasons why you haven't seen Christianity and other religions within the United States going like a rocket ship - like our polls have been going in the last four weeks, a rocket ship, right?  I really believe that, because you're great people. The people that you rely on on Sunday and all during the week, they've been stopped from talking and speaking by a law. And we're going to get rid of that law and it's going to get rid of - we're going to get rid of it so fast.\n\nAnd I'm so proud to say - honestly, I don't want to take credit, but you had 50 people in that first meeting and many more in the second. I am so proud - I was just telling this to Tony - to say that was my idea. I figure it's the only way I'm getting to heaven, so this is going to be very -  - the only way.  So we're going to get rid of it, and we're going to let your great people speak, and you're going to see something happen that's going to be very, very good, OK? So important.\n\nI hope which means you have to get out and vote on November 8th. You cannot - you didn't vote four years ago. You didn't vote.\n\n\nYou did? Well, you did. A few of you did.  Believe me, I know. I look at the stats. You didn't vote. But this time you really have - and this is your last chance. This is it. I mean, we'll never have this opportunity again. So I hope you can get every one of your friends and just get up - your family and your friends, and get out and vote, OK? November 8th.  Thank you.  And if you do, we're going to win by a lot. That's not going to even be a close election. And if you don't, could be a very unhappy November 8th.\n\nWe're also going to repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare -  - which gives the government control over the lives of everyday citizens. And the numbers are horrendous. Your premiums are going up by 50, 60, 70 percent. The deductible is so high you never get to use it unless you are going to lead a very long and very complex bad period - very, very long. It is a disaster. It's a disaster, and everybody knows it. And it's going to die of its own weight anyway, but we're going to get rid of it and we're going to replace it with some great, great alternatives - much better health care at a much lower price. \n\nHillary Clinton wants to have completely government-run health care, which would be a disaster for the liberties and freedoms of all America. That's what she wants. That's what she's aiming at. That's what Obama wanted. He didn't quite get there, but he got this, and you see how bad this has been.\n\nOne of the biggest issues in this race is going to be the issue of school choice.  And I can't possibly emphasize this enough. Millions of poor and disadvantaged students are trapped in failing schools. This education crisis afflicts all communities, but none more so than the African-American community - none. The Democratic Party has run the inner cities of America for 50, 60, 70 years, some cases over a hundred years - over a hundred years. Their policies and their politics, and in particular the politics of people like Hillary Clinton, have produced only poverty, joblessness, and rising crime.\n\nWhen she was running for the Senate in New York State, she said she was going to produce jobs, jobs, jobs in Upstate New York. It's a disaster. She's going to produce jobs, big thing - jobs, we're going to bring back jobs. Been a catastrophe. We've lost tens of thousands of jobs. She never did a thing. It was all talk, no action, just like what she's doing right now is all talk, no action. She'll talk and talk, and nothing will happen. Only bad will happen. But you just have to ask the people in Upstate New York. She won because of them, and she produced absolutely nothing. Jobs left. It's today one of the worst, one of the most depressing places in this country. So just remember that when you hear her talking about jobs. I know jobs. She doesn't know jobs. That I can tell you. \n\nI have outlined a new civil rights agenda for our time - the right to a safe community, a great education and a secure job. \n\nAnd I say to African-American parents, I say to Hispanic American parents - and I say it with great respect - our inner cities are a disaster - crime, no jobs, education is the worst, in many cases almost worldwide bad and in many cases actually worldwide bad. I say, with great respect, what do you have to lose? It can't get any worse. It can't get any worse. You choose Donald Trump, I'm going to fix the problem. You're going to have safety.  You're going to have good education. We're going to get jobs, because we're going to bring our jobs back. Mexico's taking our jobs. So many other places, they're taking our jobs. What China's doing to us is horrible. We're going to have jobs. What do you have to lose? I'm going to fix this. I'm going to fix it. \n\nSchool choice is at the center of this civil rights agenda, and my goal is to provide every single inner-city child in America that is trapped in a failing government school the freedom to attend the school of their choice. Competition - the schools the schools will get better and better and better. \n\nAnd that means a private school, a religious school, a charter school or a magnet school. School choice also means that parents can home-school their children.  Hundred percent.\n\nHillary Clinton opposes school choice because she is controlled totally, totally, like a puppet, by special interests. Her policies will force millions of African-American and Hispanic children to remain stuck in failed government schools, leading to higher unemployment and more poverty. The poverty levels in this country nobody will believe, nobody will believe.\n\nMy plan will break the government monopoly and make schools compete to provide the best services for our children -  - including every African-American and Hispanic child in this country, every single one of them. \n\nThis proposal begins with a $20 billion block grant from the federal government for states to pursue school choice programs.  However - that's good, right?  However, because 90 percent of education spending is at the state level, I will campaign to get the states to reallocate another $110 billion of their education budgets to school choice programs. \n\nIf we do this, that would mean $12,000 in school choice funds for every disadvantaged student in America. What a difference this is going to make. The money will follow the student to the public, private or religious school that is best for them and their family. In so many ways, you're going to have choice.\n\nMy administration will partner with the leadership of any inner-city - anybody - anybody in the inner cities of America willing to run a pilot program - and there will be a lot of them - to provide school choice to every child in that community. In Baltimore, for instance, that would mean more than $15,000 in funds available per student.\n\nAs your president, I will be the biggest cheerleader for school choice you've ever seen.  This means a lot to me, because I know it can turn things around. Again, the education can't get worse. Commo Core - we're going to end it.  We're bringing education local.\n\nI will fight for every child in this country who deserve better futures. The African-American community has heard my message that I am going to make the inner city safe again, and I'm going to bring back jobs, and I'm going to bring back the great education. Don't be surprised - remember this, November 8th - don't be surprised, because we have been given a lot of support over the last three or four weeks, if on November 8th I get more African-American and Hispanic votes than anyone thought possible about a month ago. You see what's going on? \n\nThey're starting - people are starting to hear about this. And they're saying, wow. Wow. They're liking it. And again, can't get any worse. It's going to get a lot better. But only if I do it. They can't do it. The Democrats, they have - what they've done is incredible. And Hillary Clinton will be absolutely more of the same - rigid. It'll never change. Remember, a hundred years, 70 years, 50 - it's not going to change. Not going to happen.\n\nNow, let's talk about another issue that will define the future of this country for generations to come, the United States Supreme Court.  Earlier this year, we lost the great justice, Antonin Scalia. The next president will not only have to fill this seat, but as many as four others. It could even be - I mean, we could end up with a total of five judges by one president. It would be record-setting. Probably be three. Could be four. Could even be five. And you pick the wrong people, you have a country that is no longer your country. It will be a disaster.\n\nOne of the most important issues, frankly - other than maybe defense, because we're going to build up our military, it's so depleted.  We're going to take care of our vets. We're going to protect your Second Amendment, so many things. But one of the most important - some people think it's actually the most important - is the filling of the seats, United States Supreme Court. You see what's happening right now? Essentially it's four and four. And you see what - how bad it is. We're going to pick great judges. I've already put a list of 11 Federalist Society, highly recommended, got uniform great reviews on these 11 people. And we are going to put truly great people. Maybe we use Judge Scalia of the ultimate example of what we're looking for, OK? \n\nThis will determine whether or not we remain a constitutional republic, frankly. That's what's going to happen. I have pledged to appoint judges who uphold the Constitution, to protect your religious liberty, and apply the law as written.  We reject judges who rewrite the Constitution to impose their own person views on 300 million-plus Americans. We're not going to have that. I've made public a list of judges, as I said, that will guide my selection process. Hillary Clinton has refused to provide such a list. And we brought it up.\n\nLet's see a list. You ever saw the list you would walk out of here not feeling very well.  Because she knows the extremist judges she would pick would be rejected by the overwhelming majority of the American public. They'd be rejected. Clinton's judicial picks would allow her to completely take over American health care, the American economy, and Americans religious liberty - not to mention your Second Amendment, which is on very thin ice right now, as you know, because of the fact that we're at four-and-four. If they even pick one judge who's wrong you can probably - as you know it - you can kiss the Second Amendment goodbye. And we don't want to see that.\n\nAnother issue in this race of great importance to everyone in this room is the issue of course of national security. Just today it was announced that North Korea performed its fifth nuclear test - its fourth since Hillary Clinton became secretary of state. It's just one more massive failure from a failed secretary of state.  Failed at everything. Her policies have also put Iran onto a path of nuclear weapons, and I have to say made them overnight an absolute power. They were dying three years ago. The sanctions were choking them. They would have fallen. But Obama didn't support people that would have taken over, and I think in this case probably would have taken over the right way; had no support.\n\nBut you look at what's happened to Iran in such a short period of time. But remember the ransom payments. Remember, it was $400 million two weeks ago. But then they made a mistake. This is cash. Remember, they said they paid cash because they couldn't open a bank account. There was no way of sending it into a checking account.  All lies, just like Obamacare was a big lie, remember? You can use your plan. You can use your doctors - 27 times, right? Twenty-seven times. You can use your doctors, use your plan; turned out to be a lie. It's all a lie. It's all a big lie. It's a rigged system and it's a lie.\n\nAnd I'll tell you what. I'll tell you what. The 400 million (dollars), for those that haven't been reading the papers over the last two days, turned out to be 1.7 billion (dollars) in cash - cash. And I actually said - they said, oh, that money's going to be used for terror. I said, no, they don't need it for terror. They've got 150 billion (dollars). That's in addition to the $150 billion that we're giving back. I said they don't need it. This is going into their Swiss accounts and going into their accounts. They're not going to use it for terror. They have plenty of money for terror.\n\nThink of it - $1.7 billion (dollars) in cash - massive, big vats of cash. You saw them - cartons. I never saw anything like it. I've seen a lot of cash.  Hey, never saw anything like this - $1.7 billion (dollars). Can you imagine these guys? Planes get - they stop. Remember, they wouldn't give back the hostages. They waited there for hours and hours. And Obama kept saying, no, no, this has nothing to do - even the hostages said they kept us waiting for a certain plane to come in, not to take them back, because they were waiting for something. It was this - just another lie.\n\nBut can you imagine these people sitting there and they see $1.7 billion (dollars) in cash? Ai, yai, yai. They think we're stupid.  They think we're stupid. They won't be thinking it for long.  Very sad. \n\nAt the same time, ISIS is hunting down and exterminating what it calls the nation of the cross. ISIS is carrying out a genocide against Christians in the Middle East. We cannot let this evil continue - can 't let it.  ISIS must be destroyed - have to; have no choice.\n\nTo defeat ISIS, we must use military warfare, but also cyber warfare, financial warfare and ideological warfare. It's a whole different ballgame today than it was 50 years ago and 200 years ago - different world.\n\nWe must also establish a bipartisan goal in the United States and an international goal with our allies of defeating radical Islamic terrorism -  - words that our president won't use and words that Hillary Clinton won't use. Just like we won the Cold War by identifying our enemy and building a consensus to guide a long-term strategy, so too must we do the same with Islamic terrorism.\n\nBy the way, President Obama has allowed Syrian refugees to pour into our country at unbelievable rates. And Hillary Clinton wants to allow 550 percent more. But it's almost impossible to get a Christian in from Syria. They take others, but they don't take Christians - very, very, very rare.\n\nSo I said that we need to make safe zones in the region. We want to take care of people. But we absolutely cannot allow this potential tremendous threat to continue, and we have to stop this. This is going to be potentially a catastrophe for our country. It's from within. This could be the all-time great Trojan horse. This could be it.\n\nYou ever notice on the - you look at the migration trail and you see people with cellphones. Cellphones. And some of the cellphones have the ISIS flag printed on them. And some of them have things far worse than that - scenes far worse than that.\n\nSo it was the failed policies, you have to remember, of Hillary Clinton and Obama that unleashed ISIS in the first place. If they did the right thing, you wouldn't be talking about ISIS right now.  Now she wants to get rid of - oh, we're going to get rid of them. You know, she tells them already there will be no boots on the ground. Now, even if you don't want boots on the ground, you don't want to say it. Don't say it! Now they're saying, oh, I hope she wins. Oh, boy, would they dream of having her as president. Can you -  - they dream about it every night, having Hillary Clinton. But even if you believe - and I can understand that. No boots on the ground, I can understand. You don't say it! Let them think they're going to go through hell. Don't say it! \n\nCan you imagine the great General Douglas MacArthur, can you imagine the great General George Patton, or one of our great generals that we have today - General Flynn, who's here someplace -  - I love General Flynn - but can you imagine these people saying - I mean, they're basically giving out the strategy: there will be no boots on the ground. If you don't want that, I fully understand. Don't say it! Don't say it! Could you imagine MacArthur saying we're going to fight the enemy, and we're going to move our troops in in about a month, we're going to hit from behind?  We're going to hit them from the front, then - and everything they say turns out to be true? You know, I hate to say this because we have a lot of Evangelicals in this room, but maybe we shouldn't be so honest when it comes to military strategy. Does that make sense?  Hope I didn't lose your vote for saying that. \n\nJust look at what her policies have left us with in Iraq, Syria and Libya. The problem is Hillary Clinton is trigger-happy. She really is. She's trigger-happy, and yet she says no boots, which is sort of - probably will be boots, you know. Probably will turn out to be another disaster. He tenure has brought us only war and destruction and death. She's just too quick to intervene, invade, or to push for regime change with people we don't even know who they are. And they take over, and they're far worse. This creates the power vacuums that are filled by terrorist and groups like ISIS.\n\nMy administration, on the other hand, will work with any country that is willing to partner with us to defeat ISIS and halt radical Islamic terrorism. And by the way, that includes Russia. If they want to join us on knocking out ISIS, that is just fine as far as I'm concerned.  It's a very imperfect world, and you can't always choose your friends. That's life.\n\nBut you can never fail to recognize your enemies. We have some real enemies. Unfortunately for our country, our enemies probably hacked into Hillary Clinton's emails. These are the same emails she destroyed after receiving a federal subpoena. What's that? Using software in order to bleach the emails so you can never, ever see them. She even mysteriously lost 13 different phones before the FBI got them, and many were destroyed with a hammer.  Did anybody ever hit a hammer - you know, maybe two or three people, but they were just released from prison, those two people.  Can you believe this? Destroyed them with a hammer - the old-fashioned way, I guess. \n\nThe other night in the Commander in Chief Forum - did anybody see that?  How did I do?  Good. Well, we have a big debate coming up. Who knows what's going to happen there? But I will say, every poll has me winning big league at the Commander in Chief.  We had - the polls came out after that event and we won big league. Now we have a debate coming up. I don't imagine any of you going to be watching the debate, right? \n\n\nI won't; I promise. Hillary Clinton answered questions on her emails horribly. That's why she lost. That's why she did so poorly. She was terrible. She was - honestly, I shouldn't be saying this - she was terrible.  She keeps talking about the emails. Every time she talks about them, she talks about them differently.  It seems each week, true, she has, like, a different answer. But there can be no answer when she deletes 33,000 emails, bleaches them so they can never be recovered - an unheard-of practice - hammers them into total silence. You know what happening. You know what's happening.\n\nI always say, getting away with that will be the single greatest accomplishment of her career.  It's true. It's true.  So her answers were bad. They were bad. And a lot of people said they were so totally dishonest. And you know, she was blaming Matt Lauer. I thought Matt Lauer did a very good job. I mean, his questions to me were very tough.  But the gentleman who stood up and said: Honestly, you should be in prison for what you did -  - to me, that was the tough one.  That was the tough - hey, that was a tough question.  It was sort of a question in the form of a statement, right? \n\nHillary Clinton is unfit to be our president, for many reasons.  True. True.  She's unfit for many reasons, the biggest of which is her judgement. It's just so bad.  It's time to restore honestly and integrity to our government.  Have to do it.\n\nAnd one more issue, finally issue I want to discuss today is the economy, and helping those in need. There is no more charitable group in this country than Christians.  And all of us through - and all of us here today are determined to lift suffering Americans out of poverty. Going to do it, with a lot of other people going to help. As you president, I will pursue a complete reform of our economy to bring back millions of new jobs into our country - millions of new jobs.  We've lost our jobs like we're a bunch of babies. They've gone to other countries. They've gone to Mexico. They've gone to many other countries. China's taking massive advantage of us. It's all so easy, believe me. It's all so easy.\n\nThat includes, we will be doing massive tax cuts for working families and for businesses.  It includes, very importantly, the elimination of all needless job-killing regulations.  It includes lifting the restrictions on American energy, which is under siege.  I will also renegotiate NAFTA. And if they don't want to renegotiate it so it becomes a two-way highway, not just a one-way highway out of the United States for our companies and our jobs, we will terminate NAFTA, believe me.  We'll stand up to China, and we're going to fight for every last job. It's going to be America first, and it's going to be the American worker first. \n\nCrucially, I will also fight for the American family and American family values. The family must be at the center of any anti-poverty agenda. Has to be.  Thank you.\n\nOur country just lost one of the great champions for the American family, Phyllis Schlafly. Great woman, really great woman.  We send our thoughts and prayers to her loved ones. I will be going to her funeral tomorrow in St. Louis. \n\nPhyllis fought very hard to the very end for a free and prosperous America. She understood that, to be truly united as a country, we can't simply turn to government or to politicians. The bedrock of our unity is the realization that we are all brothers and sisters created by the same God. Phyllis understood that.  Phyllis understood that.\n\nAnd by the way, Phyllis endorsed me a long time ago, when it wasn't necessarily -  - something that was so easy to do. And she was incredible. She was so brave. She endorsed me, and that was not the thing to do at the time. People said, Trump? She said, he's going to win, you don't understand. He knows how to win. He's going to win.  They said, Phyllis, not going to be Trump. And we went boom, boom, boom. But I will tell you, Phyllis endorsed me at a time when it wasn't necessarily the thing to do, even the popular thing to do, and I will never forget that. That had a huge impact. She was a great, great, powerful woman with a tremendous heart. And I look forward to being with her family tomorrow, because you really - that's a celebration. She was 92 years old. \n\nWe are all equal, and we all come from the same Creator. If we remember that simple fact, then our future is truly limitless. There is nothing we as Americans can't do.\n\nThere's a biblical verse that I have often read, and I want to repeat it again because I think it is so important to what we're trying to achieve right now for our country. It's from 1 John, Chapter 4: \"No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, God lives in us, and His love is made complete in us.\"\n\nSo true.  So true. \n\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one God, saluting one flag.  It's time to stop quibbling over the smallest words and time to start dreaming about the great adventures that lie ahead for our country.\n\nThis is my promise to all of you: starting in 2017, we will be one American nation. It's time to break our ties with the bitter failures of the past and to embrace a new American future. Have to do it. Together, we will make America believe again, we will make America united again, and we will make America great again. Thank you very much, and God bless you. Thank you.  Thank you. Thank you very much.\u0000","20":"Thank you all! Whoa! Thank you! Thank you. Well, I got to tell you, this is sure worth staying up for. It is so great to be here in Raleigh, here at North Carolina State University. And I cannot imagine a better way of ending this campaign than having the opportunity to see all of you and to watch and listen to Lady Gaga. One of the most inventive, creative and passionate performers, whose range goes from A to Z and beyond. And I was watching on the screen not only her perform, but all of you jumping and singing and waving. It was great!\nBecause, you know what? That's what I want for America and the young people of America: the joy, the passion, the intensity! And our longtime friend, Jon Bon Jovi, was with us. He was with us up in Philadelphia, where he and Bruce Springsteen sang. And Jon said, 'Well, hey, I want to go down to Raleigh,' and so here he is! And between now and the time the poll closes tomorrow, we are going to be living on a prayer.\n\nI was really impressed when everybody's hand went up saying you'd already voted. Well, go find somebody else who hasn't voted, okay? Bring out your friends, your roommates, strangers on the street. Just stop and talk to them about what's at stake in this election. Because North Carolina is key, and it's not only important for our election. Are you ready to elect Roy Cooper as your next governor? Well, I sure hope so. I sure hope so, and I hope you're ready to elect Linda Coleman your lieutenant governor. And how about Dan Blue, III, for state treasurer? And I really, really hope you will send Deborah Ross to Washington!\n\nNow, we are all fired up. When we were with the President and Michelle in Philadelphia. You know, the President was talking about how absolutely consequential this election is, and of course it is. I really believe it's the most important election of our lifetimes because we've never had a clearer choice. Never. It is a choice between division or unity; between strong, steady leadership or a loose cannon who could risk everything. It's a choice between an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. And it is a choice that really goes to the heart of who we are as Americans.\n\nWhat I saw before I came in and what I see now is a sense of potential, of joy. There is no reason, my friends, why America's best days are not ahead of us if we reach for them together. We don't have to accept a dark and divisive vision for America. Tomorrow you can vote for a hopeful, inclusive, big-hearted America.\n\nOur core values - our core values are being tested in this election, but my faith in our future has never been stronger. I love our country and I believe in the American people. And I know if we bring everyone together, we can set goals and we can move toward them and we can feel that sense of accomplishment that comes with being part of something bigger than ourselves.\n\nYou know, one of the great privileges of crisscrossing the country, as I have in this campaign, is meeting remarkable people - people who stand up against the odds; people who, like my late mother, people who understand that everybody gets knocked down. What matters is whether you get back up, whether you believe you can keep going.\n\nLast night, in Manchester, New Hampshire, I had the honor of being introduced by an extraordinary man, Khizr Khan, whose son, Captain Khan, was killed serving our country in Iraq. You may remember Mr. Khan's speech at the Democratic Convention. And again last night, he reminded us of the responsibility we all share to protect and defend our Constitution. The story of Captain Khan is one of courage in the face of danger. He was with his unit when he saw a suspicious vehicle. He told his men to stay back. He moved toward the vehicle to check it out. And the bomb went off. He lost his life, but everyone else in his unit survived. He was awarded the Bronze Star. And this intensely personal tragedy that the Khan family experienced, becoming a Gold Star family, was one that they thought about, grieved over in the privacy of their home, until they heard my opponent start talking about who was acceptable in America and who wasn't. The categories of people, starting with immigrants, including African Americans and Latinos and POWs and Muslims. The list went on and on. And it created in Mr. Khan a sense of despair because he asked himself, would his son have a place in Donald Trump's America? Someone who paid the ultimate price in serving our country.\n\nWell, we can answer that question tomorrow resoundingly: Yes. Absolutely.\n\nThink about - think about how generations of Americans throughout our history have come together to meet the tests of their time. Our parents, our grandparents, our great-grandparents defended democracy. They built the great American middle class. They marched for civil rights and voting rights, for workers' rights, and women's rights, for LGBT rights, and the rights of people with disabilities. And tomorrow we face the test of our time.\n\nSo, remember, it's not just my name or Donald Trump's name on the ballot. It's the kind of country we want. It's every issue anyone cares about. So if you believe America thrives when the middle class thrives, then you have to vote tomorrow. If you believe we should make the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II in infrastructure, advanced manufacturing, clean energy, small business, then you have to vote. If you believe we need more fairness in our economy to raise the minimum wage because no one who works full-time should still be in poverty, then you have to vote. If you believe we need to do more to support working families with affordable childcare, paid leave, and equal pay for women, then you have to vote. And, remember, when my opponent says every time I talk about these issues that I'm playing the woman's card, well, you know what I say. Deal me in. And if you believe, if you believe, all kids deserve good schools with good teachers, no matter what house they live in, you have to vote. And if you believe college should be more affordable, you have to vote. Bernie Sanders and I worked on a plan to make public colleges and universities tuition-free if you earn less than $125,000 and debt-free for everybody else. And for the millions of Americans struggling with student debt, we are going to help you pay that down and pay that off. If you believe in science and that we've got to address climate change, you have to vote. If you believe we need to reform our criminal justice system so everyone is treated fairly, then you have to vote. And if you believe - if you believe we should never write discrimination into our laws, well, then you know, you know, North Carolina. You've got to vote to get rid of HB2!\n\nNow, this is so energizing, we could keep going with a long list. But here's what - here's what else I want you to know. A good thing this election didn't land during exams, that's all I can say. Look. Tomorrow - tomorrow night, this election will end. But I want you to understand, our work together will be just beginning. We have to bridge the divides in this country. As the Bible says, we have to repair the breaches. We've got to be willing to start listening to each other again, respecting each other again. And I want to thank Gaga because she has always stood for that fundamental principle of respecting everybody.\n\nSo I want you to know and I want you to spread the word. I do want to be President for all Americans, not just some, not just the people who support me and vote for me. I want to be President for everyone because we all have a role to play in building that better future for our country and for each of you.\n\nSo if you haven't voted yesterday, go to iwillvote.com. You can get all the info you need. And you can still sign up to volunteer. Right? Go to hillaryclinton.com or text 'join,' j-o-i-n, to 47246, or stop by one of our offices. We would welcome you to help make sure everybody gets out to vote tomorrow because none of us want to wake up Wednesday morning and wish we had done more. Right?\n\nAnd years from today, when your kids and grandkids ask what you did in 2016 when everything was on the line, you'll be able to say you voted for a stronger, fairer, better America, an America where we build bridges, not walls, and where we prove conclusively that yes, love trumps hate! Thank you! Let's go vote, North Carolina! God bless you! Thank you all very much!\u0000","21":"Thank you.\nIn 19 days, we are going to win the state of Ohio and we are going to win the White House.\n\nEarly voting is underway, so make sure to mail in your ballot or vote in-person.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen, I want to make a major announcement today. I would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters, and to all of the people of the United States, that I will totally accept the results of this great and historic Presidential election - if I win!\n\nLadies and Gentlemen, I want to make a major announcement today. I would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters, and to all of the people of the United States, that when the results come in on election night, I will accept - without delay or hesitation - the concession speech of Hillary Rodham Clinton.\n\nNow, seriously, the debate last night was amazing and everybody said I won, including every single online poll, some by 90-10.\n\nThe question of voter fraud came up during the debate. We want fairness in the election, having nothing to do with me and having to do with the future of the country.\n\nJohn Podesta, Hillary's Campaign Chairman, was quoted in WikiLeaks, as saying illegal immigrants could vote as long as they have Drivers' Licenses.\n\nOne of the big issues that came up last night was the fact that the Clinton Campaign has paid people to disrupt our rallies and incite violence. This is criminal behavior that violates centuries of tradition on peaceful, Democratic elections.\n\nA campaign like Clinton's that will incite violence is truly a campaign that will do anything.\n\nAnd a candidate, like Hillary Clinton, who will lie to the Congress and the FBI, destroy 33,000 emails, put her office up for sale, and put our confidential information in reach of our enemies - is a candidate who is truly capable of anything.\n\nIn addition, it was just learned, Hillary was given the exact debate questions, word for word, by Donna Brazile - who is now under tremendous pressure to resign. But I ask you, why shouldn't Hillary Clinton resign from the race - she was given the questions, used the questions, and never said that she did something that was totally inappropriate?\n\nYears ago there was a show called the $64,000 question - he got the questions in advance, his life was ruined. This is even bigger, because we are playing for the presidency of the United States.\n\nHillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the Presidency.\n\nSo it's in that context I was asked a question about whether I would agree, in advance, to concede the results on election night. This is an unprecedented question. If Al Gore or George Bush had agreed 3 weeks before the election to concede the results and waive their right to a legal challenge or a recount, then there would be no Supreme Court case and no Bush V. Gore.\n\nIn effect, I'm being asked to waive centuries of legal precedent designed to protect the franchise of voters.\n\nAccording to Pew, there are 24 million voter registrations in the United States that are either invalid or significantly inaccurate.\n\n1.8 million dead people are registered to vote (some of whom vote even though they are dead - which is a hard thing to do, but easy if fraud is involved).\n\n2.8 million people are registered in more than one state.\n\nAnd 14% of non-citizens are registered to vote.\n\nSo what I'm saying is, we have to be vigilant and we have to be careful.\n\nAmerica is a Constitutional Republic with a system of laws. These laws are triggered in the case of fraud, or in the event a recount is needed.\n\nOf course I would accept a clear election result, but I would also reserve my right to contest or file a legal challenge in the case of a questionable result. I will follow and abide by all of the rules and traditions of all the candidates who came before me.\n\nBut, none of this will matter, since we are going to win big on November 8th.\n\nTogether, we are going to deliver real change that puts America First.\n\nWe are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals, end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, reduce surging crime, cut taxes and regulations, unleash job-producing American energy, rebuild our military and take care of our Vets, and repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.\n\nYour jobs will come back under a Trump Administration. Your incomes will go up under a Trump Administration. Your taxes will go way down under a Trump Administration. Your companies won't be leaving Ohio under a Trump Administration.\n\nRight now, our economy isn't growing at all. I'm going to get us to 4% growth and create 25 million jobs over 10 years.\n\nMany workers are earning less today than they were 18 years ago, they are working harder and longer, but making less. Some of them are working two, three jobs but still taking home less money.\n\nCompanies, like Carrier are firing their workers and moving to Mexico. Ford is moving all of its small car production to Mexico. When I'm President, if companies want to fire their workers and leave for Mexico, then we will charge them a 35% tax when they want to ship their products back in. That means the companies won't leave in the first place and, if they do, we'll at least make money when they ship their products across the border.\n\nRight now, our politicians don't do anything to keep our companies from leaving because they are controlled by lobbyists and special interests - Hillary Clinton has raised countless millions of dollars from big donors who want to ship our jobs to other countries.\n\nThat is why I am proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again.\n\nIt's time to drain the swamp of corruption in Washington, D.C.\n\nThose reforms include the following:\n\nA 5 year-ban on executive branch and congressional officials lobbying the government after they leave government service.\n\nA lifetime ban on former executive branch officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government.\n\nA ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections.\n\nAdditionally, I am going to push for a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress.\n\nIt's about time.\n\nNot only will we end our government corruption, but we will end the economic stagnation.\n\nMy plan for the economy can be summed up in three simple words: jobs, jobs, jobs.\n\nAt the center of my historic jobs plan will be fixing our terrible trade deals.\n\n47 million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are on Food Stamps.\n\nWe have nearly an $800 billion annual trade deficit in goods with the world, and the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.\n\nOhio has lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA and China's entrance into the World Trade Organization - two Bill and Hillary-backed disasters.\n\nWe are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.\n\nA Trump Administration is going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to foreign cheating, and stop the jobs from leaving our country.\n\nI also have another major announcement I am going to make today that concerns manufacturing in the United States, and how we are going to bring jobs back to Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and all across this great nation.\n\nAmerican trade policy is currently mismanaged by dozens of competing bureaucracies spread across the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Labor, State and Treasury Department and the U.S. Trade Representative.\n\nIn my administration, all trade policymaking will be consolidated in one Office. It will report to an American Desk and it will be located inside the Department of Commerce. The mission of the American Desk will be to protect the economic interests of the American worker, and the national interests of the United States.\n\nIt's going to be America First.\n\nAs part of our plan to bring back our jobs, we are going to lower our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent.\n\nWe are also going to rebuild our inner cities.\n\nAfrican-Americans and Hispanics living in the inner cities are suffering. The violence is unbearable. You walk to the store with your child and you get shot. There is no education, there are no jobs, there is no safety.\n\nNearly 3,500 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.\n\nHomicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.\n\nAnd it's getting worse.\n\nTo the African-American and Hispanic voters suffering, I say: what do you have to lose? Vote for Donald Trump. I will fix it.\n\nWe will be a rich nation once again.\n\nBut to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country.\n\nNational Security begins at the border.\n\nSpeaking in secret to a foreign bank Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally \"open trade and open borders.\"\n\nHillary's plan includes an open border with the Middle East - meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within our shores.\n\nJust last week, an Iraqi refugee approved for entry by Hillary Clinton's State Department pled guilty to joining ISIS.\n\nSo let me state this as clearly as I can. If I'm elected President I am going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country.\n\nWe will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration.\n\nA Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders. And yes, we will build a wall.\n\nWe have the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers.\n\nThere is another major policy announcement I would like to make today. Every year, countless American lives are lost to Sanctuary Cities. My opponent strongly supports Sanctuary Cities, like the ones that got Kate Steinle killed by a five-time deported criminal illegal immigrant.\n\nIf I am elected President, I am going to cut off federal funding to Sanctuary Cities that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.\n\nWe are going to save American lives.\n\nEither we win this election, or we lose the country.\n\nHere are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:\n\nWe are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation; defend religious liberty; provide school choice to every low-income child in America, and we are going to end common core; support the men and women of law enforcement; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\n\nYou have 19 days to make every dream you ever dreamed of for your country come true.\n\nOur campaign is powered by our love for this country and our love for our fellow citizens. It's a campaign about rejecting the cynicism and elitism of our failed political establishment.\n\nI am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation.\n\nI'm going to fight for every child living in poverty. I'm going to fight for every mom whose lost her child to illegal immigration, and drugs and gang violence.\n\nI'm going to fight for every community whose jobs and factories have been ripped out of states like Ohio and shipped to other countries.\n\nI'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people - not the donors and special interests.\n\nAnd I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.\n\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\n\nYou're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this day. This is a movement like you've never seen before. You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote you've ever cast for anyone at any time.\n\nBecause if we win -\n\nWe Will Make America Wealthy Again.\n\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\n\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\n\nAnd We Will Make America Great Again.\u0000","22":"Thank you for the invitation to speak to you today. It's wonderful to be in Detroit.\nWe now begin a great national conversation about economic renewal for America. It's a conversation about how to Make American Great Again for everyone, and especially those who have the very least.\n\nThe City of Detroit Is Where Our Story Begins\n\nDetroit was once the economic envy of the world. The people of Detroit helped power America to its position of global dominance in the 20th century.\n\nWhen we were governed by an America First policy, Detroit was booming. Engineers, builders, laborers, shippers and countless others went to work each day, provided for their families, and lived out the American Dream.\n\nBut for many living in this city, that dream has long ago vanished.\n\nWhen we abandoned the policy of America First, we started rebuilding other countries instead of our own. The skyscrapers went up in Beijing, and in many other cities around the world, while the factories and neighborhoods crumbled in Detroit. Our roads and bridges fell into disrepair, yet we found the money to resettle millions of refugees at taxpayer expense.\n\nToday, Detroit has a per capita income of under $15,000 dollars, about half of the national average. 40 percent of the city's residents live in poverty, over two-and-half times the national average. The unemployment rate is more than twice the national average. Half of all Detroit residents do not work.\n\nDetroit tops the list of Most Dangerous Cities in terms of violent crime--these are the silenced victims whose stories are never told by Hillary Clinton, but victims whose suffering is no less real or permanent.\n\nIn short, the city of Detroit is the living, breathing example of my opponent's failed economic agenda. Every policy that has failed this city, and so many others, is a policy supported by Hillary Clinton.\n\nShe supports the high taxes and radical regulation that forced jobs out of your community-\u00c2\u0089and the crime policies that have made you less safe-\u00c2\u0089and the immigration policies that have strained local budgets...and the trade deals like NAFTA, signed by her husband, that have shipped your jobs to Mexico and other countries-\u00c2\u0089 and she supports the education policies that deny your students choice, freedom and opportunity.\n\nShe is the candidate of the past.\n\nOurs is the campaign of the future.\n\nThis is a city controlled by Democratic politicians at every level, and unless we change policies, we will not change results.\n\nToday, I will outline my economic vision. In the coming weeks, we will be offering more detail on all of these policies, and the ones we have already rolled out can be viewed on my campaign website.\n\nOur opposition, on the other hand, has long ago run out of ideas. All Hillary Clinton has to offer is more of the same: more taxes, more regulations, more bureaucrats, more restrictions on American energy and American production.\n\nIf you were a foreign power looking to weaken America, you couldn't do better than Hillary Clinton's economic agenda.\n\nNothing would make our foreign adversaries happier than for our country to tax and regulate our companies and our jobs out of existence.\n\nThe one common feature of every Hillary Clinton idea is that it punishes you for working and doing business in the United States. Every policy she has tilts the playing field towards other countries at our expense.\n\nThat's why she tries to distract us with tired political rhetoric that seeks to label us, divide us, and pull us apart.\n\nMy campaign is about reaching out to everyone as Americans, and returning to a government that puts the American people first.\n\nHere is what an America First economic plan looks like.\n\nFirst, let's talk tax reform.\n\nTaxes are one of the biggest differences in this race.\n\nHillary Clinton--who has spent her career voting for tax increases--plans another massive job-killing $1.3 trillion-dollar tax increase. Her plan would tax many small businesses by almost fifty percent.\n\nRecently, at a campaign event, Hillary Clinton short-circuited again--to use a now famous term--when she accidentally told the truth and said she wanted to raise taxes on the middle class.\n\nI am proposing an across-the-board income tax reduction, especially for middle-income Americans. This will lead to millions of new good-paying jobs.\n\nThe rich will pay their fair share, but no one will pay so much that it destroys jobs, or undermines our ability to compete.\n\nAs part of this reform, we will eliminate the Carried Interest Deduction and other special interest loopholes that have been so good for Wall Street investors, and people like me, but unfair to American workers.\n\nTax simplification will be a major feature of the plan.\n\nOur current tax code is so burdensome and complex that we waste 9 billion hours a year in tax code compliance.\n\nMy plan will reduce the current number of brackets from 7 to 3, and dramatically streamline the process. We will work with House Republicans on this plan, using the same brackets they have proposed: 12, 25 and 33 percent. For many American workers, their tax rate will be zero.\n\nWhile we will develop our own set of assumptions and policies, agreeing in some areas but not in others, we will be focused on the same shared goals and guided by the same shared principles: jobs, growth and opportunity.\n\nThese reforms will offer the biggest tax revolution since the Reagan Tax Reform, which unleashed years of continued economic growth and job creation.\n\nWe will Make America Grow Again.\n\nIn the days ahead, we will provide more details on this plan and how it will help you and your family. It will present a night-and-day contrast to the job-killing, tax-raising, poverty-inducing Obama-Clinton agenda.\n\nThe State of New York has already lived through Hillary Clinton's failed leadership. The Washington Post just published a devastating article on Hillary Clinton's broken promises. She pledged 200,000 jobs for upstate New York as Senator. But what happened? The Washington Post writes, and I quote: \"upstate job growth stagnated overall during her tenure, with manufacturing jobs plunging nearly 25 percent-\u00c2\u0089the former first lady was unable to pass big ticket legislation-\u00c2\u0089 Many promised jobs never materialized and others migrated to other states as she turned to her first presidential run-\u00c2\u0089data shows that upstate actually lost jobs during Clinton's first term.\"\n\nCompare that to my record. In a recent New York Post article by Steve Cuozzo, \"How Donald Trump Helped Save New York City,\" the paper writes that I--and this is a direct quote--\"waded into a landscape of empty Fifth Avenue storefronts, the dust-bowl mugging ground that was Central Park and a Wall Street area seemingly on its last legs as companies moved out-\u00c2\u0089almost by force of will --  rode to the rescue. Expressing rare faith in the future, he was instrumental in kick-starting the regeneration of neighborhoods and landmarks almost given up for dead.\"\n\nThis is what I want to do for our country--I want to jumpstart America.\n\nNow let's look at what the Obama-Clinton policies have done nationally.\n\nTheir policies produced 1.2% growth, the weakest so-called recovery since the Great Depression, and a doubling of the national debt.\n\nThere are now 94.3 million Americans outside the labor force. It was 80.5 million when President Obama took office, an increase of nearly 14 million people.\n\nThe Obama-Clinton agenda of tax, spend and regulate has created a silent nation of jobless Americans.\n\nHome ownership is at its lowest rate in 51 years.\n\nNearly 12 million have been added to the food stamp rolls since President Obama took office. Another nearly 7 million Americans were added to the ranks of those in poverty.\n\nWe have the lowest labor force participation rates in four decades.\n\n58 percent of African-American youth are either outside the labor force or not employed.\n\n1 in 5 American households do not have a single member in the labor force. These are the real unemployment numbers--the five percent figure is one of the biggest hoaxes in modern politics.\n\nMeanwhile, American households are earning more than $4,000 less today than they were sixteen years ago.\n\nThe average worker today pays 31.5 percent of their wages to income and payroll taxes. On top of that, state and local taxes consume another 10 percent.\n\nThe United States also has the highest business tax rate among the major industrialized nations of the world, at 35 percent. It's almost 40 percent when you add in taxes at the state level.\n\nIn other words, we punish companies for making products in America--but let them ship products into the U.S. tax-free if they move overseas.\n\nThis is backwards. All of our policies should be geared towards keeping jobs and wealth inside the United States.\n\nUnder my plan, no American company will pay more than 15% of their business income in taxes. Small businesses will benefit the most from this plan. Hillary Clinton's plan will require small business to pay as much as three times more in taxes than what I am proposing, and her onerous regulations will put them totally out of business. I am going to cut regulations massively.\n\nOur lower business tax will also end job-killing corporate inversions, and cause trillions in new dollars and wealth to come pouring into our country--and into cities like Detroit. To help unleash this new job creation, we will allow businesses to immediately expense new business investments.\n\nNo one will gain more from these proposals than low-and-middle income Americans.\n\nMy plan will also help reduce the cost of childcare by allowing parents to fully deduct the average cost of childcare spending from their taxes.\n\nWe are also going to bring back trillions of dollars from American businesses that is now parked overseas. Our plan will bring that cash home, applying a 10 percent tax. This money will be re-invested in states like Michigan.\n\nFinally, no family will have to pay the death tax. American workers have paid taxes their whole lives, and they should not be taxed again at death--it's just plain wrong. We will repeal it.\n\nNext comes regulatory reform\n\nAs with taxes, I will have one overriding goal when it comes to regulation: I want to keep jobs and wealth in America.\n\nMotor vehicle manufacturing is one of the most heavily regulated industries in the country. The U.S. economy today is twenty-five percent smaller than it would have been without the surge of regulations since 1980.\n\nIt is estimated that current overregulation is costing our economy as much as $2 trillion dollars a year--that's money taken straight out of cities like yours.\n\nThe federal register is now over 80,000 pages long. As the Wall Street Journal noted, President Obama has issued close to four hundred new major regulations since taking office, each with a cost to the American economy of $100 million or more.\n\nIn 2015 alone, the Obama Administration unilaterally issued more than 2,000 new regulations--each a hidden tax on American consumers, and a massive lead weight on the American economy.\n\nIt is time to remove the anchor dragging us down.\n\nUpon taking office, I will issue a temporary moratorium on new agency regulations. My running mate, Mike Pence, signed a similar order when he became governor of Indiana. This will give our American companies the certainty they need to reinvest in our community, get cash off of the sidelines, start hiring for new jobs, and expanding businesses.\n\nI will also immediately cancel all illegal and overreaching executive orders.\n\nNext, I will ask each and every federal agency to prepare a list of all of the regulations they impose on Americans which are not necessary, do not improve public safety, and which needlessly kill jobs. Those regulations will be eliminated.\n\nWe are in a competition with the world, and I want America to win. When I am president, we will.\n\nOne of the most important reforms of all is trade reform\n\nAs Bernie Sanders has said, Hillary Clinton has bad judgment. We've seen this bad judgment overseas, in Libya, Iraq, and Syria. We've seen it in Iran. We've seen it from President Obama, when he gives $150 billion to Iran, the number one terror state, and even gives them $400 million in money-laundered cash as a ransom payment.\n\nBut we've also seen the terrible Obama-Clinton judgment right here in Detroit.\n\nHillary Clinton has supported the trade deals stripping this city, and this country, of its jobs and wealth.\n\nShe supported Bill Clinton's NAFTA, she supported China's entrance into the World Trade Organization, she supported the job-killing trade deal with South Korea, and she supports the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n\nLet's talk about South Korea for a moment, because it so perfectly illustrates the broken promises that have hurt so many American workers.\n\nPresident Obama, and the usual so-called experts who've been wrong about every trade deal for decades, predicted that the trade deal with South Korea would increase our exports to South Korea by more than $10 billion--resulting in some 70,000 jobs.\n\nLike Hillary Clinton's broken promises to New York, these pledges all turned out to be false. Instead of creating 70,000 jobs, it has killed nearly 100,000, according to the Economic Policy Institute. Our exports to South Korea haven't increased at all, but their imports to us have surged more than $15 billion--more than doubling our trade deficit with that country.\n\nThe next betrayal will be the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Hillary Clinton's closest friend, Terry McAuliffe, confirmed what I have said on this from the beginning: if sent to the Oval Office, Hillary Clinton will enact the TPP. Guaranteed. Her donors will make sure of it.\n\nA vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for TPP--and it's also a vote for NAFTA.\n\nOur annual trade deficit in goods with Mexico has risen from close to zero in 1993 to almost $60 billion. Our total trade deficit in goods hit nearly $800 billion last year.\n\nThis is a strike at the heart of Michigan, and our nation as a whole.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, before NAFTA went into effect, there were 285,000 auto workers in Michigan. Today, that number is only 160,000.\n\nDetroit is still waiting for Hillary Clinton's apology. I expect Detroit will get that apology right around the same time Hillary Clinton turns over the 33,000 emails she deleted.\n\nHillary Clinton's Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) will be an even bigger disaster for the auto industry. In fact, Ford Motor Company has announced its opposition to the deal.\n\nAccording to the Economic Policy Institute, the U.S. trade deficit with the proposed TPP member countries cost over 1 million manufacturing jobs in 2015.\n\nBy far the biggest losses occurred in motor vehicles and parts, which lost nearly 740,000 manufacturing jobs.\n\nMichigan ranks first for jobs lost as a share of state workforce due to the trade deficit with TPP members.\n\nJust imagine how many more automobile jobs will be lost if the TPP is actually approved. That is why I have announced we will withdraw from the deal before that can ever happen. Hillary Clinton will never withdraw from the TPP. She is bought, controlled and paid-for by her donors and special interests.\n\nBecause my only interest is the American people, I have previously laid out a detailed 7-point plan for trade reform, available on my website. It includes strong protections against currency manipulation, tariffs against any countries that cheat by unfairly subsidizing their goods, and it includes a renegotiation of NAFTA. If we don't get a better deal, we will walk away.\n\nAt the center of my plan is trade enforcement with China. This alone could return millions of jobs into our economy.\n\nChina is responsible for nearly half of our entire trade deficit. They break the rules in every way imaginable. China engages in illegal export subsidies, prohibited currency manipulation, and rampant theft of intellectual property. They also have no real environmental or labor protections, further undercutting American workers.\n\nJust enforcing intellectual property rules alone could save millions of American jobs. According to the U.S. International Trade Commission, improved protection of America's intellectual property in China would produce more than 2 million more jobs right here in the United States.\n\nAdd to that the saved jobs from cracking down on currency cheating and product dumping, and we will bring trillions of dollars in new wealth and wages back to the United States.\n\nTrade has big benefits, and I am in favor of trade. But I want great trade deals for our country that create more jobs and higher wages for American workers. Isolation is not an option, only great and well-crafted trade deals are.\n\nAlso critical to our economic renewal will be energy reform\n\nThe Obama-Clinton Administration has blocked and destroyed millions of jobs through their anti-energy regulations, while raising the price of electricity for both families and businesses.\n\nAs a result of recent Obama EPA actions coal-fired power plants across Michigan have either shut down entirely or undergone expensive conversions. The Obama-Clinton war on coal has cost Michigan over 50,000 jobs. Hillary Clinton says her plan will \"put a lot of coal companies and coal miners out of business.\"\n\nWe will put our coal miners and steel workers back to work.\n\nClinton not only embraces President Obama's job-killing energy restrictions but wants to expand them, including going after oil and natural gas production that employs some 10 million Americans.\n\nAccording to the Heritage Foundation, by 2030, the Obama-Clinton energy restrictions will eliminate another half a million manufacturing jobs, reduce economic output by $2.5 trillion dollars, and reduce incomes by $7,000 dollars per person.\n\nA Trump Administration will end this war on the American worker, and unleash an energy revolution that will bring vast new wealth to our country.\n\nAccording to the Institute for Energy Research, lifting the restrictions on all sources of American energy will:\n\nIncrease GDP by more than $100 billion dollars annually, add over 500,000 new jobs annually, and increase annual wages by more than $30 billion dollars over the next 7 years;\n\nIncrease federal, state, and local tax revenues by almost $6 trillion dollars over 4 decades;\n\nIncrease totaleconomic activity by more than $20 trillion dollars over the next 40 years.\n\nThe reforms I have outlined today are only the beginning\n\nWhen we reform our tax, trade, energy and regulatory policies, we will open a new chapter in American Prosperity.\n\nWe can use this new wealth to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.\n\nAs part of this new future, we will also be rolling out proposals to increase choice and reduce cost in childcare, offering much-needed relief to American families. I will unveil my plan on this in the coming weeks that I have been working on with my daughter Ivanka and an incredible team of experts.\n\nLikewise, our education reforms will help parents send their kids to a school of their choice.\n\nWe will also give our police and law enforcement the funds and support they need to restore law and order to this country. Without security, there can be no prosperity. We must have law and order.\n\nIn the coming days, we will be rolling out plans on all of these items. One of my first acts as President will be to repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare, saving another 2 million American jobs.\n\nWe will also rebuild our military, and get our allies to pay their fair share for the protection we provide--saving us countless more billions to invest in our own country.\n\nWe also have a plan, on our website, for a complete reform of the Veterans Health Administration. This is something so desperately needed to make sure our vets are fully supported and get the care they deserve.\n\nDetroit--the Motor City--will come roaring back. We will offer a new future, not the same old failed policies of the past.\n\nOur party has chosen to make new history by selecting a nominee from outside the rigged and corrupt system.\n\nThe other party has reached backwards into the past to choose a nominee from yesterday--who offers only the rhetoric of yesterday, and the policies of yesterday.\n\nThere will be no change under Hillary Clinton--only four more years of Obama.\n\nBut we are going to look boldly into the future.\n\nWe will build the next generation of roads, bridges, railways, tunnels, sea ports and airports that our country deserves.\n\nAmerican cars will travel the roads, American planes will connect our cities, and American ships will patrol the seas.\n\nAmerican steel will send new skyscrapers soaring.\n\nWe will put new American metal into the spine of this nation.\n\nIt will be American hands that rebuild this country, and it will be American energy--mined from American sources--that powers this country.\n\nIt will be American workers who are hired to do the job.\n\nAmericanism, not globalism, will be our new credo.\n\nOur country will reach amazing new heights.\n\nAll we have to do is stop relying on the tired voices of the past.\n\nWe can't fix a rigged system by relying on the people who rigged it in the first place.\n\nWe can't solve our problems by relying on the politicians who created them.\n\nOnly by changing to new leadership, and new solutions, will we get new results.\n\nWe need to stop believing in politicians, and start believing in America.\n\nBefore everything great that has ever happened, the doubters have always said it couldn't be done.\n\nAmerica is ready to prove the doubters wrong.\n\nThey want you to think small. I am asking you to think big.\n\nWe are ready to dream great things for our country once again.\n\nWe are ready to show the world that America is Back--Bigger, and Better and Stronger Than Ever Before.\n\nThank you, and God Bless You.\u0000","23":"It's so great to be here tonight. I am honored to also be joined this evening by Governor Scott Walker, Chairman Reince Priebus, and Mayor Rudy Giuliani.\nWe are at a decisive moment in this election.\n\nLast week, I laid out my plan to bring jobs back to our country. Yesterday, I laid out my plan to defeat Radical Islamic Terrorism. Tonight, I am going to talk about how to make our communities safe again from crime and lawlessness.\n\nLet me begin by thanking the law enforcement officers here in this city, and across this country, for their service and sacrifice in difficult times.\n\nThe violence, riots and destruction that have taken place in Milwaukee is an assault on the right of all citizens to live in security and peace.\n\nLaw and order must be restored. It must be restored for the sake of all, but most especially the sake of those living in the affected communities.\n\nThe main victims of these riots are law-abiding African-American citizens living in these neighborhoods. It is their jobs, their homes, their schools and communities which will suffer as a result.\n\nThere is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct. Crime and violence is an attack on the poor, and will never be accepted in a Trump Administration.\n\nThe narrative that has been pushed aggressively for years now by our current Administration, and pushed by my opponent Hillary Clinton, is a false one. The problem in our poorest communities is not that there are too many police, the problem is that there are not enough police.\n\nMore law enforcement, more community engagement, more effective policing is what our country needs.\n\nJust like Hillary Clinton is against the miners, she is against the police. You know it, and I know it.\n\nThose peddling the narrative of cops as a racist force in our society - a narrative supported with a nod by my opponent - share directly in the responsibility for the unrest in Milwaukee, and many other places within our country.\n\nThey have fostered the dangerous anti-police atmosphere in America.\n\nEverytime we rush to judgment with false facts and narratives - whether in Ferguson or in Baltimore - and foment further unrest, we do a direct disservice to poor African-American residents who are hurt by the high crime in their communities.\n\nDuring the last 72 hours, while protestors have raged against the police here in Milwaukee, another 9 were killed in Chicago and another 46 were wounded. More than 2,600 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year, and almost 4,000 killed in President Obama's hometown area since his presidency began.\n\nHow are we serving these American victims by attacking law enforcement officers?\n\nThe war on our police must end. It must end now.\n\nThe war on our police is a war on all peaceful citizens who want to be able to work and live and send their kids to school in safety.\n\nOur job is not to make life more comfortable for the rioter, the looter, the violent disruptor. Our job is to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent who wants their kids to be able to safely walk the streets. Or the senior citizen waiting for a bus. Or the young child walking home from school.\n\nFor every one violent protestor, there are a hundred moms and dads and kids on that same city block who just want to be able to sleep safely at night. My opponent would rather protect the offender than the victim.\n\nHillary Clinton-backed policies are responsible for the problems in the inner cities today, and a vote for her is a vote for another generation of poverty, high crime, and lost opportunities.\n\nI care too much about my country to let that happen.\n\nWe all care too much about our country to let that happen.\n\nGood policing saves lives. My dear friend, Rudy Giuliani, knows a thing or two about this. The policies put into place by Rudy ultimately brought down crime by 76 percent and murder by 84 percent. Think of how many families were saved, how much heartache was prevented, when police were put into communities and criminals were removed.\n\nImagine how many lives could have been saved, all across this country, if Democratic politicians hadn't blocked in their cities what Rudy did in New York City? I'll make sure we deliver safe neighborhoods here in Milwaukee, and all across this country.\n\nIt's easy for Hillary Clinton to turn a blind eye to crime when she has her own private security force. I believe all Americans, not just the powerful, are entitled to security.\n\nHillary Clinton has had her chance. She failed. Now it's time for new leadership.\n\nThe Hillary Clinton agenda hurts poor people the most.\n\nThere is no compassion in allowing drug dealers, gang members, and felons to prey on innocent people. It is the first duty of government to keep the innocent safe, and when I am President I will fight for the safety of every American - and especially those Americans who have not known safety for a very, very long time.\n\nI am asking for the vote of every African-American citizen struggling in our country today who wants a different future.\n\nIt is time for our society to address some honest and very difficult truths.\n\nThe Democratic Party has failed and betrayed the African-American community. Democratic crime policies, education policies, and economic policies have produced only more crime, more broken homes, and more poverty.\n\nLet us look at the situation right here in Milwaukee, a city run by Democrats for decade after decade. Last year, killings in this city increased by 69 percent, plus another 634 victims of non-fatal shootings. 18-29-year-olds accounted for nearly half of the homicide victims. The poverty rate here is nearly double the national average. Almost 4 in 10 African-American men in Milwaukee between the ages of 25-54 do not have a job. Nearly four in 10 single mother households are living in poverty. 55 public schools in this city have been rated as failing to meet expectations, despite ten thousand dollars in funding per-pupil. There is only a 60% graduation rate, and it's one of the worst public school systems in the country.\n\n1 in 5 manufacturing jobs has disappeared in Milwaukee since we fully opened our markets to China, and many African-American neighborhoods have borne the brunt of this hit.\n\nTo every voter in Milwaukee, to every voter living in every inner city, or every forgotten stretch of our society, I am running to offer you a better future.\n\nThe Democratic Party has taken the votes of African-Americans for granted. They've just assumed they'll get your support and done nothing in return for it. It's time to give the Democrats some competition for these votes, and it's time to rebuild the inner cities of America - and to reject the failed leadership of a rigged political system.\n\nI'm not part of the corrupt system. In fact, the corrupt system is trying to stop me. I've been paying my own way. The voters in the Republican Party this year defied the donors, the consultants, the power brokers, and choose a nominee from outside our failed and corrupt and broken system.\n\nThe other party - the Democratic Party - nominated the personification of special interest corruption. The Democratic Party rigged the nomination to give it to Hillary Clinton, thus giving the soul of their party this year to the special interests.\n\nI am running to listen to your voice, to hear your cries for help. The quiet voices in our society, not the loudest demonstrators, need to have their demands heard.\n\nJobs. Safety. Opportunity. Fair and equal representation.\n\nWe reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton which panders to and talks down to communities of color and sees them only as votes, not as individual human beings worthy of a better future. She doesn't care at all about the hurting people of this country, or the suffering she has caused them.\n\nThe African-American community has been taken for granted for decades by the Democratic Party. It's time to break with the failures of the past - I want to offer Americans a new future.\n\nIt is time for rule by the people, not rule by special interests.\n\nEvery insider, getting rich off of our broken system, is throwing money at Hillary Clinton. The hedge fund managers, the Wall Street investors, the professional political class.\n\nIt's the powerful protecting the powerful.\n\nInsiders fighting for insiders.\n\nI am fighting for you.\n\nWhen we talk about the insider, who are we talking about? It's the comfortable politicians looking out for their own interests. It's the lobbyists who know how to insert that perfect loophole into every bill. It's the financial industry that knows how to regulate their competition out of existence. The insiders also include the media executives, anchors and journalists in Washington, Los Angeles, and New York City, who are part of the same failed status quo and want nothing to change.\n\nEvery day you pick up a newspaper, or turn on the nightly news, and you hear about some self-interest banker or some discredited Washington insider says they oppose our campaign. Or some encrusted old politician says they oppose our campaign. Or some big time lobbyist says they oppose our campaign.\n\nI wear their opposition as a badge of honor. Because it means I am fighting for REAL change, not just partisan change. I am fighting - all of us across the country are fighting - for peaceful regime change in our own country. The media-donor-political complex that's bled this country dry has to be replaced with a new government of, by and for the people.\n\nThe leadership class in Washington D.C., of which Hillary Clinton has been a member for thirty years, has abandoned the people of this country.\n\nI am going to give the people their voice back.\n\nThink about it. The people opposing our campaign are the same people who have left our border open and let innocent people suffer as a result.\n\nThe people opposing our campaign are the same people who have led us into one disastrous foreign war after another.\n\nThe people opposing our campaign are the same people who lied to us about one trade deal after another.\n\nAren't you tired of a system that gets rich at your expense?\n\nAren't you tired of big media, big businesses, and big donors rigging the system to keep your voice from being heard?\n\nAre you ready for change?\n\nAre you ready for leadership that puts you, the American people, first? That puts your country first? That puts your family first?\n\nLet's talk about what this means for the inner cities of America. It's time to break through the television noise, the entrenched interests. I understand that a lot of powerful people in our political system - a lot of people who've created our problems - will lose a lot of their contracts, and their special gigs, if African-American voters, and all minority voters, support my campaign.\n\nIt's time to stop making the special interests rich. It's time to make the American people rich.\n\nI am going to Make America Wealthy again.\n\nThe Democratic Party has run nearly every inner city in this country for 50 years, and run them into financial ruin.\n\nThey've ruined the schools.\n\nThey've driven out the jobs.\n\nThey've tolerated a level of crime no American should consider acceptable.\n\nViolent crime has risen 17% in America's 50 largest cities last year. Killings of police officers this year is up nearly 50 percent. Homicides are up more than 60% in Baltimore. They are up more than 50% in Washington, D.C.\n\nThis is the future offered by Hillary Clinton. More poverty, more crime, and more of the same. The future she offers is the most pessimistic thing I can possibly imagine.\n\nIt is time for a different future.\n\nHere is what I am proposing.\n\nFirst, on immigration. No community in this country has been hurt worse by Hillary Clinton's immigration policies than the African-American community. Now she is proposing to print instant work permits for millions of illegal immigrants, taking jobs directly from low-income Americans. I will secure our border, protect our workers, and improve jobs and wages in your community. We will only invite people to join our country who share our tolerant values, who support our Constitution, and who love all of our people.\n\nOn trade, I am going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to China, withdraw from the TPP, and protect every last American job.\n\nOn taxes, I am going to give a massive tax cut to every worker and small business in this country, bring thousands of new companies and millions of new jobs onto our shores - and make it very difficult for our businesses to leave.\n\nI am going to reform our regulations so jobs stay in America, and new businesses come to America to hire workers right here in Milwaukee. Every policy my opponent has sends jobs overseas. I am going to bring trillions in new wealth back to the United States.\n\nOn education, it is time to have school choice, merit pay for teachers, and to end the tenure policies that hurt good teachers and reward bad teachers. We are going to put students and parents first.\n\nHillary Clinton would rather deny opportunities to millions of young African-American children, just so she can curry favor with the education bureaucracy.\n\nI am going to allow charter schools to thrive, and help young kids get on the American ladder of success: a good education, and a good-paying job.\n\nOn crime, I am going to support more police in our communities, appoint the best prosecutors and judges in the country, pursue strong enforcement of federal laws, and I am going to break up the gangs, the cartels and criminal syndicates terrorizing our neighborhoods. To every lawbreaker hurting innocent people in this country, I say: your free reign will soon come crashing to an end.\n\nOn healthcare, we are going to get rid of Obamacare - which has caused soaring double-digit premium increases - and give choice to patients and consumers. Aetna, just today, announced they are dropping out - as are many of the major insurance companies.\n\nOn government corruption, I am going to restore honor to our government. We've seen the corruption of Hillary Clinton, the mass email deletions, the pay-for-play at the State Department, the profiteering, the favors given to foreign corporations and governments at your expense. We've seen a former Secretary of State lie to Congress about her illegal email scheme, risk innocent American lives, and bring dishonor onto our government.\n\nIn my Administration, I am going to enforce all laws concerning the protection of classified information. No one will be above the law.\n\nI am going to forbid senior officials from trading favors for cash by preventing them from collecting lavish speaking fees through their spouses when they serve.\n\nI am going to ask my senior officials to sign an agreement not to accept speaking fees from corporations with a registered lobbyist for five years after leaving office, or from any entity tied to a foreign government. This is all just the beginning.\n\nWe are going to make this a government of the people once again. This is our chance to take back power from all the people who've taken it from you. The reason you see the establishment media lining up behind my opponent is because they are scared that you, with your vote, can take away their power and return it to your family and community.\n\nThese are tough times. But I know we can make American Greater Than Ever Before.\n\nTo do this, we are going to need a fighter in the White House.\n\nI will be your fighter.\n\nTo defeat crime and Radical Islamic Terrorism in our country, to win trade in our country, you need tremendous physical and mental strength and stamina. Hillary Clinton doesn't have that strength and stamina. She cannot win for you.\n\nMost importantly, she has bad judgment. Bad judgment on terrorism, bad judgement on foreign policy, bad judgment on trade.\n\nThe only individuals she's ever delivered for is her donors - not the people.\n\nI've said it before, and I'll say it again. My opponent asks her supporters to repeat a three-word pledge. Her pledge reads: \"I'm With Her\"\n\nI choose to recite a different pledge. My pledge reads: \"I'm With You - the American people.\"\n\nI will fight to ensure that every American is treated equally, protected equally, and honored equally. We will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms, and seek a new future of security, prosperity and opportunity - a future built on our common culture and values as one American people.\n\nI am asking for your vote so I can be your champion in the White House. We will once again be a country of law and order, and a country of great success.\n\nTo every parent who dreams for their children, and to every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I'm with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you.\n\nTogether, We will make America strong again.\n\nWe will make American safe again.\n\nAnd we will make America great again.\n\nThank you, and God Bless.\u0000","24":"Thank you! Boy! Wow! Thank you! Wow! Did anybody see that debate last night? Oh, yes. One down, two to go. I am so excited to be back here at Wake Tech. I was here 8 years ago, and I was so impressed then with the kinds of programs and opportunities that are offered here to people like Christine that I wanted to come back, of course, to Raleigh, but I wanted to come back here to Wake Tech. When Christine was talking, I was backstage watching her on a screen we had there. And she kept saying about how she was about to cry. I was about to cry. Her story says so much, not just about her but about our country. We are a country of second chances and third and fourth chances for people willing to work for them, get up every day, do their best. That's the basic bargain of America. And I was really proud of Christine.\n\nThank you. Thank you. And I think her - I think her patients at Duke Regional are in for a treat because not only the skills that she learned here at Wake Tech but that personality, that get-up-and-go personality, is going to mean a lot to the people she's taking care of. So Christine, thank you and Godspeed.\n\nNow, I have to thank - I have to thank Dr. Stephen Scott, the president of Wake Tech Community College, all the administrators, the faculty, and the students of Wake Tech. Now, Dr. Scott told me that the enrollment's about 73,000. And what a tribute to what this institution represents. And I am a huge, huge supporter. I just see America differently. I think there's nothing we can't do if we make our minds up, roll up our sleeves, get working together, support institutions like Wake Tech, support people like Christine. And that's what I intend to do.\n\nNow, I want to thank your mayor, Mayor McFarlane. Thank you so much for being here. State Senator Dan Blue, Jr. I also want to recognize Linda Coleman, candidate for lieutenant governor of North Carolina. Linda came so close last time. And this time are you going to bring her over the finish line? And I'll tell you somebody else I'm really excited about. That is the Democratic candidate for the Senate, former State Representative Deborah Ross. I have watched - I have watched the campaign she's run and the intensity and the incredible passion that she brings to it. I'll tell you what, we sure could use her in Washington representative North Carolina. I want to thank all the elected officials who are here, and I want to do a special shout-out to a long-time friend of my husband's and mine, somebody who we admire so much who did really transform this state during his governorship. That's former Governor Jim Hunt.\n\nThank you! Boy! Wow! Thank you! Wow! Did anybody see that debate last night? Oh, yes. One down, two to go. I am so excited to be back here at Wake Tech.

I want to thank all the elected officials who are here, and I want to do a special shout-out to a long-time friend of my husband's and mine, somebody who we admire so much who did really transform this state during his governorship. That's former Governor Jim Hunt.\n\nNow, there's a lot that I want to talk about today. But let me start with this because you may or may not know. Today is National Voter Registration Day. And you see some signs people are holding. 'I Will Vote.' Now, that's not only a great sign that shows you're committed to vote, but it's a website. And you can go to iwillvote.com to make sure you are registered. And I hope you all will, and I hope you'll tell everybody that you know to do the same, because we want to make sure people are registered.\n\nAnd there is still time to get registered here in North Carolina, and I hope that you will, because think about everything that's at stake in this election right here in North Carolina. The very mean-spirited, wrong-headed decision by your legislature and governor to pass and sign House Bill 2 has hurt this state. But more than that, it's hurt people. It has sent a message to so many people that, well, you're not really wanted. You're not really part of us. I think the American dream is big enough for everybody.\n\nThe other thing your governor and legislature did was everything they could to make voting harder for people. Now, they were pretty blatant about it. Make it harder for people of color. Make it harder for the elderly. And make it harder for the young. Now, some of that's been rolled back, thankfully, because it was so wrong and, I would argue, unconstitutional. But the best way to show, hey, in a democracy like ours we can have the most vigorous, vibrant debate, that's what it's about. But we want everybody to exercise his or her right to vote. That's the way we're supposed to be making decisions. It distorts our democracy if some groups of people try to prevent other people from being able to do that.\n\nNow, I have won elections and I have lost elections, so I know what the difference is. But I'll tell you this: I believe in what our founders established for us, to govern ourselves, to continue to widen the circle of opportunity, and that includes the opportunity to be heard, to express yourself, your voice and your vote. And the best way to reaffirm our commitment to that fundamental American value is to show up and vote, and demonstrate the importance of your vote.\n\nI believe that we may have a record-setting turnout in this election. Some folks who follow this are saying we could have the biggest turnout we've ever had. Now, that kind of makes sense because you could not have two more different visions about where we want our country to go in the future, and who we are fighting for. But early information is actually quite encouraging. We're seeing spikes in early voting. And we're seeing voting rates among African Americans, Latinos, and young people going up. And for the first time, the estimate is that young people could represent 25 percent of the vote.\n\nNow, I would love to see that. Obviously, I hope people vote for me. But I would love to see that because every election is about the future. And honestly, it's more about the future of young people and children than it's ever been because of the difference in the approaches and the experiences of me and my opponent.\n\nNow, last night I got a chance - I got a chance to say a few things about what I want to do if I'm so fortunate enough to be elected as your president. And I do have this old-fashioned idea that if I'm asking for your vote, I should tell you what I want to do. And I also got to convey my excitement about what we can do together. You see, I really think the central question in this election is what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we want to build for our children and our grandchildren.\n\nAnd I also got to convey my excitement about what we can do together. You see, I really think the central question in this election is what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we want to build for our children and our grandchildren. I think about that a lot, in part because I started out working for the Children's Defense Fund. It's always been my passion about what we can do  to help more kids live up to their God-given potential.\n\nAnd during this campaign, people have asked me, 'Well, how did you get interested in that?'And the simple answer is my mother had such a neglected childhood. She was basically abandoned by her parents, sent to live with grandparents who didn't want her. By the age of 14, she was out on her own working in a home babysitting, keeping house. She was basically a maid. And when I think about my mother's own life and how she told me when I was old enough to understand how different her life was than the one that she created for me and my brothers, she would say she was so often saved by the kindness of other people.\n\nWe overlook the importance of just how we treat each other, the respect we show, the kindness, the love that we show. And I'm well aware that's not something you put necessarily on a campaign website, but I've been talking about it because I think we've got to re-assert our fundamental connection to each other.\n\nWhen my mother was in first grade, she never had any food, and her first grade teacher noticed that. In those days, they just brought food, a little bag of food, then they'd sit in the classroom and eat it, and my mother never had any food. And that first grade teacher noticed that and began to bring extra food but without embarrassing her. She would say, 'You know, Dorothy, I brought too much food. Would you like this sandwich? Would you like this milk?' And it wasn't until she herself was much older that my mother realized that that teacher fed her for that school year, something she didn't have to do, but her love for her students, her recognition of a child who wasn't well taken care of meant that she stepped in.\n\nAnd then when my mother worked as a maid, she really wanted to go to high school. She started working right before she would have been in high school because she had to get out of her grandparents' home. And the woman she worked for realized how much my mother wanted to go to high school, and so she said to her, 'If you get up early - it sounds like Christine getting up so early. If you get up early and you get your chores done, you can go to high school.' And that's what my mother did for four years, she got up early and then she literally had to run, run to get to high school. It sounds harsh, but not for my mom. She thought it was such a great gift of kindness that this woman gave her a place to live, gave her food to eat, gave her the chance to go to high school.\n\nSo when I talk about us being stronger together, I'm not just talking about what our government needs to do, I'm talking about what each of us can do to contribute. We do need to make sure - we need to make sure that our economy does work for everyone not just those at the top, and that means we've got to make investments in more good, new jobs, infrastructure jobs, advanced manufacturing jobs, technology and innovation, clean renewable energy jobs. And we've got to do more to help small businesses because that's where most of the new jobs will come from.\n\nAs I said last night, my dad was a small businessman. When he got out of the Navy after World War II, he started this small business printing drapery fabrics, and he had a print plant in Chicago. It was just - it was dark room. There was no natural light. He had two long tables and he'd spread that fabric on the table, and then he would take silkscreens - if you've ever seen one - and he'd start at one end and he'd put it down, he'd pour the paint in, and he'd take the squeegee and he'd lift it up and he'd go all the way down to the end of one table, and then he'd start on the other table, and he would do that until he got the job done. And I would help him out from time to time, so I knew how hard he worked. But he was so proud that he could give us a good middle class life because his dad was a factory worker. And so he was able to do what we want to see in America, keep going, keep reaching, move as high as your hard work and ambition will take you.\n\nSo I want us to have an economy that works for everyone, to grow the economy, to create more jobs, but I also want a fairer economy because - when you work hard, you should not be still in poverty at the end of the year. But if you are a minimum wage worker, if you work full time minimum wage, you will make $15,000 a year. Two-thirds of minimum wage workers are women, most of them with families to support. And I've talked to a lot of these women. Sometimes I'll be at a cafe or sometimes I'll be in a store and I'll just start talking to them, and they will tell me - it's one of the most humbling experiences about being out there talking to people is that if you're open to it, folks will tell you what's on their minds and their hearts.\n\nSo I've met women who are working two full-time minimum wage jobs to make enough to be able to support their kids. So we need to raise the national minimum wage and - and we need to guarantee, finally, equal pay for women's work because - number one, it's fair. It's fair. And if your mother, your wife, your sister, or your daughter is working, don't you want to see her paid what she should be paid for the work she does?\n\nAnd the other thing I want to do, I want to make sure that more companies offer profit-sharing to their employees who help make the profits in the first place. It makes no sense to me that sharing in profits would only go to the top executives. I want more people in more jobs to realize the benefit of their hard work.\n\nAnd last night at the debate, one of my guests was Mark Cuban. Now, Mark Cuban, who is a real billionaire, by the way, he has used profit-sharing from his very first successful business, and he not only used it while the business was going, but when the business was sold. He shared the profits from the sale and made 300 of his employees millionaires overnight.\n\nNow, that's the kind of business leadership I want to hold up, because what we've seen from my opponent is someone, who his own campaign manager has said, builds a lot of businesses on the back of the little guy, stiffing people - dishwashers, painters, plumbers, architects, glass installers, marble installers, drapery installers - across America. Some of them have come forward. You can go to our website; you can see their stories. It's heartbreaking. And as I said last night, I'm really glad my dad never had a contract with Donald Trump when he was running his small business.\n\nAnd in addition to making the economy fair, we've got to make it work better for working families who are trying to balance family and work. It's really hard out there, isn't it? And just listening to Christine's story - getting up at 4:00 and studying, getting kids up at 7:00, going to school, going to work, going to another job - that's not an uncommon story. We've made it really hard for a lot of people.\n\nSo here's what I think we need to do, and it's not a luxury, it's a necessity - because I want more families to be able to go as far as their hard work will take them. And I've heard so many stories. They've told me - people have told me about the difficult choices they face and the stresses they're under. So let's finally, since every other advanced economy has already done this, let's have paid family leave so that when you're sick or your spouse or your child is sick or you have a newborn, you can take care of your loved ones. And let's have earned sick days so that you don't lose your job because you're sick or you go to work because you're sick. And let's finally have affordable childcare, which in lots of states costs as much or more than in-state college tuition. I don't think any family should ever have to pay more than 10 percent of your income for childcare, and we're going to fix that so that becomes the norm. And then let's make sure that every educational opportunity is available without sending you into debt and breaking your budget.\n\nNow, tomorrow in New Hampshire, Bernie Sanders and I are going to talk about the college plan for debt-free college at public universities that he and I have worked on since the end of our primary. And I want - I want every family in North Carolina to know help is on the way. And we're also going to work so that you can refinance the debt you already have at much lower rates and get it paid off a lot sooner.\n\nNow, how are we going to do that? Well, we're going to go where the money is, and the money is at the top. We're going to go after millionaires, billionaires and corporations. We're going to raise taxes on millionaires and billionaires, and we're going to close corporate loopholes. And I believe that we can get that done, in part because you're going to send Deborah Ross to the Senate so we're going to have another Democratic senator. But also because our government needs to start working for everybody again - not just those who have lobbyists and lawyers and influence. That hasn't worked out so well. We've got to get back to first principles. Our job is to give the maximum opportunities to the maximum number of Americans and to especially focus on people who are working their way out of poverty and people in the middle class who want to go as far as they can go. Let's be a government for the struggling, the striving and the successful.\n\nSo I'm excited about what we can do. I really am. And I'm going to leave it to the fact-checkers to go through all of - all of Donald Trump's claims. There were - there was a lot of work for fact-checkers last night. But here's a couple of things that caught my attention. He actually bragged about gaming the system to get out of paying his fair share of taxes. In fact, I think there's a strong probability he hasn't paid federal taxes a lot of years. And this is a man who goes around calling our military a disaster; who goes around criticizing every institution, from health care to education, our vets. But he probably hasn't paid a penny to support our troops or our vets or our schools or our health care systems.\n\nAnd when I confronted him with the reasons why he won't release his tax returns - and I got to that point where I said, well, maybe he's paid zero - he said that makes him smart. Now, if not paying taxes makes him smart, what does that make all the rest of us? I got to tell you, Bill and I have been blessed. We didn't come from millionaire families. My husband's father - his biological father died before he was born. His mother went to nursing school in order to support him. They struggled. They worked hard. And America gave him the chance to get a good education, pursue his dreams, end up being President. My dad, as I told you, worked hard.\n\nSo Bill and I have released all of our tax returns going back 40 years. And if you look, you'll see that we paid the highest marginal rate. We tried to give 10 percent to charity. Because we believe in this country and we believe with the blessings that we've been given, we should do our part.\n\nThe other thing he admitted last night was that he actually rooted for the housing crisis to happen. I don't think I'd make a big bragging point out of that. But he seemed to feel like, hey, it shows you how smart I am. He basically said, 'Yeah, if the housing market crashes, I can go in and buy stuff and make some more money.' I got to tell you, what kind of person believes that? What kind of person would want to root for nine million families losing their homes? One who should never be president is the answer to that question.\n\nAnd he made it very clear that he didn't prepare for that debate. At one point he was kind of digging me for spending time off the campaign trail to get prepared. But just trying to keep track of everything he says took a lot of time and effort. And I said, 'Yeah. You know what? I did prepare. And I'll tell you something else I prepared for. I prepared to be president of the United States, and I think that's good.'\n\nSo as I said in the beginning, we have two different visions here. I believe we are stronger together. That is at the core of what I've done over my years in advocacy and public service. I believe that America is already great, and it is our responsibility to make it even greater. I believe that as we make our economy work for everyone, we also need to keep our country safe, and we need to provide strong, steady leadership in the world with our allies and our partners. I've laid out my views on a range of national security and foreign policy issues. I've laid out my plan for defeating and destroying ISIS. And what we hear from my opponent is dangerously incoherent. It's unclear exactly what he is saying.\n\nBut words matter. And last night it sounded like he was basically telling our treaty allies in Asia, \"Hey, we're not sure we're going to be there for you even though we have a mutual defense treaty.\" Words matter. People here that and they start to doubt America's word, America's intention. I felt like I had to jump in and say, 'I just want to be clear. We will honor our treaties. We will support our allies and our partners.'\n\nThis is not reality TV. This is real. It's as real as it gets. so we're going to get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top. We're going to keep America safe, provide strong, steady leadership, and we are going to bring our country together across the divides that have pitted Americans against each other. Economic worries are not the only ones keeping families up at night, are they? There's still a lot we don't know about the recent incidents in Tulsa and Charlotte, but this we do know: We've got to bring communities together. We have to listen to each other. We have to make it clear that everyone is safer when there is respect from the law for the communities they protect, and respect for the law from the communities that are protected.\n\nAnd we've got to do something about the epidemic of gun violence that has taken too many, too many lives in our country. Again, I think we can come together. A very long majority of Americans and a majority of gun owners believe in comprehensive background checks. They believe in the Second Amendment, as I do. They believe in the right of individuals to have guns, as I do. But they believe, along with me, that we should not let guns fall into the wrong hands of people who will use them to kill other people, and make it so easy to get them.\n\nSo there's work to do. But it's great work. It's important work, starting right here in North Carolina. We have 42 days left. This election's going to be close. They all are these days. That's why every call you make, every door you knock on, every friend you register to vote, to make the difference. I want you, if you can, to text 'join,' j-o-i-n, to 47246, or go to hillaryclinton.com and sign up to volunteer here in North Carolina. And I know there's a big overflow room, and I'm told they can hear me, so to my friends in the overflow, we want you to be just as involved as anyone else. Thank you for coming.\n\nSo remember, here in North Carolina, starting on October 20th, you can register and vote early at the same time at any one-stop early voting site in your county. And remember, it's not just the presidential race. It's the governor's race, the lieutenant governor's race, the U.S. Senate race, and other races up and down the ticket. Because we want to prove who we are as Americans in this election. We're not fearful. We don't want to build walls. We want to build bridges. We don't want to turn against each other. We want to work with one another. We want to set big goals again here in our country.\n\nI've got some big goals that I know we can achieve. Take climate change, which my opponent says is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. I think it could be one of the biggest economic opportunities our country has ever seen, and I want us to take advantage of that. Do the right thing and benefit from it. That's what I'm offering. We're going to deploy a half a billion more solar panels in the first four years of my administration. And we will produce enough clean power to power every home in America within 10 years. And we're going to lead the world because some country is going to be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century. Now, the way things are stacking up, I think it's either going to be Germany, China, or us. I want it to be us and it will be us.\n\nThat is exactly right. I love this country. I'm proud of this country. I want to be a leader who brings people together in our country, sets those goals, gets about the business of achieving them, and proves once and for all that love trumps hate. Thank you!\u0000","25":"Thank you. I always look forward to coming back to Iowa, a state where I have so many friends - including your incredible governor, Terry Branstad.\nWe are doing so well in Iowa, a recent Reuters poll had us up by 10 points.\n\nOn November 8, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House.\n\nIt's going to be a victory for YOU, the American people.\n\nWe are going to take on the special interests, the lobbyists, and the corrupt corporate media that have rigged the system against everyday Americans.\n\nWe are going to create a new government that serves you, your family, and your country.\n\nLower taxes, less regulation, more affordable childcare, fair trade deals, secure borders, thriving family farms, and millions and millions of new jobs.\n\nWe are going to end the Clinton Corruption and restore dignity and honesty to government service.\n\nHillary Clinton is an insider fighting only for insiders.\n\nI am an outsider fighting for you.\n\nEverything you need to know about Hillary Clinton can be understood with this simple phrase: Follow The Money.\n\nIn her campaign for President, Hillary Clinton has received $100 million dollars in contributions from Wall Street and the hedge funds.\n\nShe received $4.1 million in speaking fees from financial firms.\n\nThe same groups paying Bill and Hillary for their speeches were lobbying the federal government.\n\nTwenty-two groups paying Bill Clinton for speeches lobbied the State Department while Hillary was Secretary of State.\n\nAnd don't forget the Clinton contributors were appointed to advisory boards by Secretary Clinton - or all the favors and access granted to those who wrote checks. She even gave up 20% of American Uranium to Russia.\n\nShe disgraced the office of Secretary of State by putting it up for sale - and if she ever got the chance, she'd put the Oval Office up for sale too.\n\nWe can't let that happen. That's why you have to go out and vote on November 8th, and early voting in Iowa starts tomorrow.\n\nShe deleted and bleached 33,000 emails after a Congressional subpoena. 13 phones missing, several destroyed with a hammer. Her staffers taking the fifth amendment, and her ringleaders getting immunity deals. Foreign enemies with easy access to hack her server. Lies to Congress, under oath, about turning over her work-related emails.\n\nThe Clintons have perfected the politics of profit.\n\nThe large corporations who support terrible trade deals that offshore jobs - they are donating to Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe Wall Street investors who have rigged the regulations against the middle class - they are donating to Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe wealthy donors who want to shut down American energy - they are donating to Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe special interests who want open borders are donating to Hillary Clinton. That's why Hillary Clinton is pushing for a 550% increase in Syrian refugees.\n\nShe and her financial backers will say anything, do anything, lie about anything to keep their grip on power - to keep their control over this country.\n\nThe American people have had it with corrupt Clinton ways. They are tired of the lies, they are tired of the trivial politics, they are tired of being talked down to, looked down upon, and treated like second class citizens.\n\nHow many more Clinton scandals can this country take - one after another after another? They are the sordid past. We are the bright future.\n\nWhile our campaign outlines big changes and bold solutions to make your life better, the Clinton campaign focuses only on small and petty distractions.\n\nNever in American history have so many serious challenges been met with so unserious a campaign as the campaign of Hillary Clinton.\n\nThis will be the year the American people say: Enough is enough.\n\nIt's time for real change - a new foreign policy, a new economic policy, a new immigration policy, a new trade policy.\n\nHillary Clinton has been a disaster for so many communities, but especially for African-American communities. I don't think African-Americans are going to come out and vote for Clinton - they are too smart, and they know they are being used. They also know that she'll do nothing for them once the election is over - she never does, and that will never change. Many of them will never forget her calling young African-American men \"super-predators.\"\n\nSame thing goes for Hispanic voters - they are tired of being used by people like Hillary Clinton, that have no intention of doing anything for them once the election is over.\n\nHillary Clinton is a vessel for the special interests trying to strip this country of its wealth, its jobs, and its status as a sovereign nation. She is a globalist who has made a career taking jobs from our country and giving them to other countries.\n\nI am not running to be President of the World. I am running to be President of the United States of America.\n\nFrom now on, it's going to be America First.\n\nHave you ever wondered why it is that all things that the American people want never seem to happen?\n\nWhy can't we have the schools we want, and the borders we want, and the security we want? Why can't we have policies that support small business, or family farms, or the miners and the steelworkers?\n\nThe answer is simple. Because the financial interests who control our politics and our media don't want these changes to happen.\n\nThese special interests control Hillary Clinton. She is their chosen representative. You can disregard everything she says and just remember this phrase: Follow The Money. She's there for only one reason, to protect her donors.\n\nLook at her career. She's been there for 30 years, and has never done anything for you and your family. She's failed at everything. She failed in Iraq, in Libya, in Syria, in Iran, in Egypt. She failed on Russia, on China, on North Korea.\n\nShe failed upstate New York.\n\nShe failed the inner cities.\n\nShe's failed women and children. I've created thousands of jobs for women in this country, of incredible talent. Hillary Clinton has been in Washington for 30 years and now 70 million American women and children are in poverty or on the brink of poverty.\n\nAnd she has been a disaster on our borders.\n\nI'd like to invite on up here Michelle Root, the mother of Sarah Root, who was killed by an illegal immigrant released into the country under the Obama catch-and-release policies championed by Hillary Clinton.\n\nHillary Clinton supports Sanctuary Cities. Where was the Sanctuary for Sarah?\n\nThe only people Hillary Clinton has ever delivered for are her donors. Just Follow The Money.\n\nHer single greatest achievement may be getting away with her massive e-mail scandal and criminal cover-up.\n\nOur campaign is taking on big business, big media and big donors - we're taking them on for YOU. So you can have the future you want.\n\nThat includes keeping your family safe.\n\nNew FBI statistics shows that homicide rose 15% last year in America's large cities, and that it's the largest single-year increase in 45 years.\n\nMore than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since January.\n\n60% of murder victims under the age of 22 in this country are African-American.\n\n45% of African-American children under the age of 6 are living in poverty.\n\nI will never back down from fighting to save American lives.\n\nI will never back down from fighting to create safety and wealth for our inner cities.\n\nMy economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs.\n\nWe will cut your taxes, reduce regulations - including on our farmers - negotiate great trade deals, unleash American energy and we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare.\n\nWe are also going to end common core and offer school choice to every disadvantaged child - including every poor Hispanic and African-American child in America.\n\nThe people getting rich off the rigged system are the people throwing their money at Hillary Clinton. Remember: Follow the Money.\n\nOur campaign is about breaking-up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We're trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives.\n\nThey're all part of the same political establishment. They go to the same restaurants, they attend the same conferences, they have the same friends and connections. And they nod along when Hillary Clinton slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable.\n\nI call you hardworking American Patriots and together we are going to save this country.\n\nGovernment will start working again. Fixing things is what I do. Just look at my projects in New York, and around the world, where I revitalized neighborhoods and lifted up skylines.\n\nAn article in the New York Post was published recently called \"How Donald Trump helped save New York City.\"\n\nThe article said, quote: \"Trump waded into a landscape of empty Fifth Avenue storefronts, the dust-bowl mugging ground that was Central Park and a Wall Street area seemingly on its last legs as companies moved out-\u00c2\u0089 Trump -- almost by force of will -- rode to the rescue. Expressing rare faith in the future, he was instrumental in kick-starting the regeneration of neighborhoods and landmarks almost given up for dead.\"\n\nThat's what I want to do for our country - I want to go into the neglected neighborhoods, the failing schools, the forgotten stretches of this nation, and unlock their potential for all of our people.\n\nTogether, we can accomplish anything we want.\n\nBut that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th - and it means you need to start voting early. Early voting is so important.\n\nYou have to knock on doors. You have to pick up that phone. You have to campaign on the streets. Spread the love that we have in this room to the people of our country. To beat the system, you have to lift your voice, pound the pavement, and get out the vote. Visit our website to find out how you can help.\n\nYou have six weeks until the election. You have six weeks to make every dream you ever dreamed for your country come true.\n\nYou have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this nation.\n\nThe arrogance of Washington, D.C. will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.\n\nThis November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is Back - Bigger and Better and Stronger than Ever Before.\n\nHere is just some of what will happen starting in January of 2017:\n\nI am going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; repeal and replace Obamacare; unleash American energy; end illegal immigration; keep Radical Islamic terrorists out of our country; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\n\nWe will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.\n\nAmerican cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.\n\nAmerican steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.\n\nAmerican hands will rebuild this nation - and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.\n\nWe will put new American steel into the spine of this country.\n\nI will fight for every neglected part of this nation - and I will fight to bring us all together as Americans.\n\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\n\nIt is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.\n\nOnce more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.\n\nWe Will Make America Wealthy Again.\n\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\n\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\n\nAnd We Will Make America Great Again.\n\nThank you, and God Bless!\u0000","26":"I'd like to take a moment to talk about the heartbreak and devastation in Louisiana, a state that is very special to me.\nWe are one nation. When one state hurts, we all hurt - and we must all work together to lift each other up. Working, building, restoring together.\n\nOur prayers are with the families who have lost loved ones, and we send them our deepest condolences. Though words cannot express the sadness one feels at times like this, I hope everyone in Louisiana knows that our country is praying for them and standing with them to help them in these difficult hours.\n\nWe are one country, one people, and we will have together one great future.\n\nTonight, I'd like to talk about the New American Future we are going to create together.\n\nLast week, I laid out my plan to bring jobs back to our country.\n\nOn Monday, I laid out my plan to defeat Radical Islamic Terrorism.\n\nOn Tuesday, in Wisconsin, I talked about how we are going to restore law and order to this country.\n\nLet me take this opportunity to extend our thanks and our gratitude to the police and law enforcement officers in this country who have sacrificed so greatly in these difficult times.\n\nThe chaos and violence on our streets, and the assaults on law enforcement, are an attack against all peaceful citizens. If I am elected President, this chaos and violence will end - and it will end very quickly.\n\nEvery single citizen in our land has a right to live in safety.\n\nTo be one united nation, we must protect all of our people. But we must also provide opportunities for all of our people.\n\nWe cannot make America great again if we leave any community behind.\n\nNearly Four in ten African-American children are living in poverty.I will not rest until children of every color in this country are fully included in the American Dream.\n\nJobs, safety, opportunity. Fair and equal representation. This is what I promise to African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and all Americans.\n\nBut to achieve this New American Future we must break from the failures of the past.\n\nAs you know, I am not a politician. I have worked in business, creating jobs and rebuilding neighborhoods my entire adult life. I've never wanted to learn the language of the insiders, and I've never been politically correct - it takes far too much time, and can often make more difficult.\n\nSometimes, in the heat of debate and speaking on a multitude of issues, you don't choose the right words or you say the wrong thing. I have done that, and I regret it, particularly where it may have caused personal pain. Too much is at stake for us to be consumed with these issues.\n\nBut one thing I can promise you is this: I will always tell you the truth.\n\nI speak the truth for all of you, and for everyone in this country who doesn't have a voice.\n\nI speak the truth on behalf of the factory worker who lost his or her job.\n\nI speak the truth on behalf of the Veteran who has been denied the medical care they need - and so many are not making it. They are dying.\n\nI speak the truth on behalf of the family living near the border that deserves to be safe in their own country but is instead living with no security at all.\n\nOur campaign is about representing the great majority of Americans - Republicans, Democrats, Independents, Conservatives and Liberals - who read the newspaper, or turn on the TV, and don't hear anyone speaking for them. All they hear are insiders fighting for insiders.\n\nThese are the forgotten men and women in our society, and they are angry at so much on so many levels. The poverty, the unemployment, the failing schools, the jobs moving to other countries.\n\nI am fighting for these forgotten Americans.\n\nFourteen months ago, I declared my campaign for the Presidency on the promise to give our government back to the people. Every day since then, I've worked to repay the loyalty and the faith that you have put in me.\n\nEvery day I think about how much is at stake for this country. This isn't just the fight of my life, it's the fight ofour lives - together - to save our country.\n\nI refuse to let another generation of American children be excluded from the American Dream. Our whole country loses when young people of limitless potential are denied the opportunity to contribute their talents because we failed to provide them the opportunities they deserved. Let our children be dreamers too.\n\nOur whole country loses every time a kid doesn't graduate from high school, or fails to enter the workforce or, worse still, is lost to the dreadful world of drugs and crime.\n\nWhen I look at the failing schools, the terrible trade deals, and the infrastructure crumbling in our inner cities, I know all of this can be fixed - and it can be fixed very quickly.\n\nIn the world I come from, if something is broken, you fix it.\n\nIf something isn't working, you replace it.\n\nIf a product doesn't deliver, you make a change.\n\nI have no patience for injustice, no tolerance for government incompetence, no sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens.\n\nThat's why I am running: to end the decades of bitter failure and to offer the American people a new future of honesty, justice and opportunity. A future where America, and its people, always - and I mean always - come first.\n\nAren't you tired of a system that gets rich at your expense?\n\nAren't you tired of the same old lies and the same old broken promises? And Hillary Clinton has proven to be one of the greatest liars of all time.\n\nAren't you tired of arrogant leaders who look down on you, instead of serving and protecting you?\n\nThat is all about to change - and it's about to change soon. We are going to put the American people first again.\n\nI've travelled all across this country laying out my bold and modern agenda for change.\n\nIn this journey, I will never lie to you. I will never tell you something I do not believe. I will never put anyone's interests ahead of yours.\n\nAnd, I will never, ever stop fighting for you.\n\nI have no special interest. I am spending millions of dollars on my own campaign - nobody else is.\n\nMy only interest is the American people.\n\nSo while sometimes I can be too honest, Hillary Clinton is the exact opposite: she never tells the truth. One lie after another, and getting worse each passing day.\n\nThe American people are still waiting for Hillary Clinton to apologize for all of the many lies she's told to them, and the many times she's betrayed them.\n\nTell me, has Hillary Clinton ever apologized for lying about her illegal email server and deleting 33,000 emails?\n\nHas Hillary Clinton apologized for turning the State Department into a pay-for-play operation where favors are sold to the highest bidder?\n\nHas she apologized for lying to the families who lost loved ones at Benghazi?\n\nHas she apologized for putting Iran on the path to nuclear weapons?\n\nHas she apologized for Iraq? For Libya? For Syria? Has she apologized for unleashing ISIS across the world?\n\nHas Hillary Clinton apologized for the decisions she made that have led to so much death, destruction and terrorism?\n\nSpeaking of lies, we now know from the State Department announcement that President Obama lied about the $400 million dollars in cash that was flown to Iran. He denied it was for the hostages, but it was. He said we don't pay ransom, but he did. He lied about the hostages - openly and blatantly - just like he lied about Obamacare.\n\nNow the Administration has put every American travelling overseas, including our military personnel, at greater risk of being kidnapped. Hillary Clinton owns President Obama's Iran policy, one more reason she can never be allowed to be President.\n\nLet's talk about the economy. Here, in this beautiful state, so many people have suffered because of NAFTA. Bill Clinton signed the deal, and Hillary Clinton supported it. North Carolina has lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA went into effect.\n\nBill Clinton also put China into the World Trade Organization - another Hillary Clinton-backed deal. Your city of Charlotte has lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs since China joined the WTO, and many of these jobs were lost while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State - our chief diplomat with China. She was a disaster, totally unfit for the job.\n\nHillary Clinton owes the State of North Carolina a very big apology, and I think you'll get that apology around the same time you'll get to see her 33,000 deleted emails.\n\nAnother major issue in this campaign has been the border. Our open border has allowed drugs and crime and gangs to pour into our communities. So much needless suffering, so much preventable death. I've spent time with the families of wonderful Americans whose loved ones were killed by the open borders and Sanctuary Cities that Hillary Clinton supports.\n\nI've embraced the crying parents who've lost their children to violence spilling across our border. Parents like Laura Wilkerson and Michelle Root and Sabine Durden and Jamiel Shaw whose children were killed by illegal immigrants.\n\nMy opponent supports Sanctuary Cities.\n\nBut where was the Sanctuary for Kate Steinle? Where was the Sanctuary for the children of Laura, Michelle, Sabine and Jamiel?\n\nWhere was the Sanctuary for every other parent who has suffered so horribly?\n\nThese moms and dads don't get a lot of consideration from our politicians. They certainly don't get apologies. They'll never even get the time of day from Hillary Clinton.\n\nBut they will always come first to me.\n\nListen closely: we will deliver justice for all of these American Families. We will create a system of immigration that makes us all proud.\n\nHillary Clinton's mistakes destroy innocent lives, sacrifice national security, and betray the working families of this country.\n\nPlease remember this: I will never put personal profit before national security. I will never leave our border open to appease donors and special interests. I will never support a trade deal that kills American jobs. I will never put the special interests before the national interest. I will never put a donor before a voter, or a lobbyist before a citizen.\n\nInstead, I will be a champion for the people.\n\nThe establishment media doesn't cover what really matters in this country, or what's really going on in people's lives. They will take words of mine out of context and spend a week obsessing over every single syllable, and then pretend to discover some hidden meaning in what I said.\n\nJust imagine for a second if the media spent this energy holding the politicians accountable who got innocent Americans like Kate Steinle killed - she was gunned down by an illegal immigrant who had been deported five times.\n\nJust imagine if the media spent this much time investigating the poverty and joblessness in our inner cities.\n\nJust think about how much different things would be if the media in this country sent their cameras to our border, or to our closing factories, or to our failing schools. Or if the media focused on what dark secrets must be hidden in the 33,000 emails Hillary Clinton deleted.\n\nInstead, every story is told from the perspective of the insiders. It's the narrative of the people who rigged the system, never the voice of the people it's been rigged against.\n\nSo many people suffering in silence. No cameras, no coverage, no outrage from a media class that seems to get outraged over just about everything else.\n\nSo again, it's not about me. It's never been about me. It's about all the people in this country who don't have a voice.\n\nI am running to be their voice.\n\nI am running to be the voice for every forgotten part of this country that has been waiting and hoping for a better future.\n\nI am glad that I make the powerful a little uncomfortable now and again - including some powerful people in my own party. Because it means I am fighting for real change.\n\nThere's a reason the hedge fund managers, the financial lobbyists, the Wall Street investors, are throwing their money at Hillary Clinton. Because they know she will make sure the system stays rigged in their favor.\n\nIt's the powerful protecting the powerful.\n\nThe insiders fighting for the insiders.\n\nI am fighting for you.\n\nHere is the change I propose.\n\nOn terrorism, we are going to end the era of nation-building and instead focus on destroying ISIS and Radical Islamic terrorism.\n\nWe will use military, cyber and financial warfare and work with any partner in the world, and the Middle East, that shares our goal of defeating terrorism. I have a message for the terrorists trying to kill our citizens: we will find you, we will destroy you, and we will win.\n\nOn immigration, we will temporarily suspend immigration from any place where adequate screening cannot be performed. All applicants for immigration will be vetted for ties to radical ideology, and we will screen out anyone who doesn't share our values and love our people. Anyone who believes Sharia law supplants American law will not be given an immigrant visa. If you want to join our society, then you must embrace our society, our values and our tolerant way of life. Those who believe in oppressing women, gays, Hispanics, African-Americans and people of different faiths are not welcome to join our country.\n\nWe will promote our America values, our American way of life, and our American system of government which are all the best in the world.\n\nMy opponent on the other hand wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees. Her plan would bring in roughly 620,000 refugees from all refugee-sending nations in her first term, on top of all other immigration. Hillary Clinton is running to be America's Angela Merkel, and we've seen how much crime and how many problems that's caused the German people.\n\nWe have enough problems already, we don't need another one.\n\nOn crime, we are going to add more police, more investigators, and appoint the best judges and prosecutors in the world. We will pursue strong enforcement of federal laws.\n\nThe gangs and cartels and criminal syndicates terrorizing our people will be stripped apart one by one. Their day is over.\n\nOn trade, we are going to renegotiate NAFTA, withdraw from the TPP, stand up to China on our terrible trade agreement, and protect every last American job.\n\nHillary Clinton has supported all of the major trade deals that have stripped this country of its jobs and its wealth.\n\nOn taxes, we are going to massively cut tax rates for workers and small businesses - creating millions of new good paying jobs.\n\nWe are going to get rid of regulations that send jobs overseas and we are going to make it easier for young Americans to get the credit they need to start a small business and pursue their dreams.\n\nOn education, we are going to give students choice, and allow charter schools to thrive. We are going to end tenure policies that reward bad teachers and hurt good ones. My opponent wants to deny students choice and opportunity, all to get a little bit more money from the education bureaucracy. She doesn't care how many young dreams are dashed in the process.\n\nWe are going to work closely with African-American parents and students in the inner cities - and what a big difference that will make. This means a lot to me, and it is going to be a top priority in a Trump Administration.\n\nOn healthcare, we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare. Countless Americans have been forced into part-time jobs, premiums are about to jump by double-digits yet again, and just this week Aetna announced it is pulling out of the exchanges in North Carolina. We are going to replace this disaster with reforms that give you choice and freedom and control in healthcare - at a much lower cost.\n\nOn political corruption, we are going to restore honor to our government.\n\nIn my Administration, I am going to enforce all laws concerning the protection of classified information. No one will be above the law.\n\nI am going to forbid senior officials from trading favors for cash by preventing them from collecting lavish speaking fees through their spouses when they serve.\n\nI am going to ask my senior officials to sign an agreement not to accept speaking fees from corporations with a registered lobbyist for five years after leaving office, or from any entity tied to a foreign government.\n\nFinally, we are going to bring this country together. We are going to do it by emphasizing what we all have in common as Americans. We are going to reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton, which sees communities of color only as votes and not as human beings worthy of a better future.\n\nIf African-American voters give Donald Trump a chance by giving me their vote, the result for them will be amazing. Look at how badly things are going under decades of Democratic leadership - look at the schools, look at the 58% of young African-Americans not working. It is time for change.\n\nWhat do you have to lose by trying something new? - I will fix it. This means so much to me, and I will work as hard as I can to bring new opportunity to places in our country which have not known opportunity in a very long time.\n\nHillary Clinton and the Democratic Party have taken African-American votes totally for granted. Because the votes have been automatically there, there has been no reason for Democrats to produce.\n\nIt is time to break with the failures of the past, and to fight for every last American child in this country to have the better future they deserve.\n\nIn my Administration, every American will be treated equally, protected equally, and honored equally. We will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms, and seek a new future built on our common culture and values as one American people.\n\nThis is the change I am promising all of you: an honest government, a fair economy, and a just society for each and every American.\n\nBut we can never fix our problems by relying on the same politicians who created these problems in the first place.\n\n72% of voters say our country is on the wrong track. I am the change candidate, Hillary Clinton is the failed status quo.\n\nIt is time to vote for a New American Future.\n\nTogether, We will make America strong again.\n\nWe will make American proud again.\n\nWe will make America safe again.\n\nFriends and fellow citizens: Come November, we will make America great again.\n\nThank You, and God Bless.\u0000","27":"Hello Cleveland. Wow. There is nothing like being introduced by Congresswoman Marcia Fudge to get everybody going.\nI am so excited to be here, what a time to be back in Cleveland.\n\nThe Indians are going to the World Series.\n\nThat is after the Cavs won the championship. What a year for Cleveland, you really are \"Believe Land.\"\n\nNow I, for one, am hoping for a Great Lakes series, I spent a lot of days at Wrigley field as a kid, so that would be a dream come true for me, to have Cleveland and Chicago in World Series, and for us to win Ohio.\n\nI want to thank all of the people who are here today because you've heard from some great, great folks. I want to thank Governor Ted Strickland, our candidate to the United States Senate. I'll tell you, we could really use a Democratic senate to get things done for the people of Ohio and America.\n\nI wanna thank Mayor Frank Jackson, County Executive, Armond Budish. I wanna thank my great friend from Youngstown, Congressman Tim Ryan.\n\nAnd we need you all in. We need you all in. You're rallying together and we need to rally together because you know, I really believe we are stronger together!\n\nAnybody watch the debate Wednesday night? Well, that was the third and last time. That I will ever have to debate Donald Trump.\n\nI have now spent four and a half hours on stage with Donald, proving once again, I have the stamina to be president and commander in chief.\n\nReally, you -- you just have to be a good cheer when you find yourself in situations like that.\n\nAnd because I love this country and I believe in the American people, I could feel so clear in my own mind and my heart about what we can do together. So no matter what he was saying, I just kept thinking of all the people that I have met throughout this campaign. And I had the chance to talk about some of the most important concerns on people's minds, what keeps you up at night. And as I said then and as I have said continuously, we're going to invest in the middle class.\n\nWe're going to invest in you and your families. We're going to make sure we produce enough good jobs with rising incomes that every single person, especially every single young American here today, will have the chance to go as far as your talents and your hard work will take you.\n\nAnd we're also going to protect our children from gun violence. We are not going to tolerate the kind of gun violence epidemic that has swept this country and results in the deaths of 33,000 people a year. We can come together to meet our challenges, no matter what they are.\n\nBut on Wednesday night, Donald Trump did something no other presidential nominee has ever done. He refused to say that he would respect the results of this election.\n\nNow, make no mistake. By doing that, he is threatening our democracy.\n\nHe is basically saying hey, we've been around 240 years and we've always had peaceful transitions no matter who won or who lost. Look, if you lose an election -- I've lost elections, you don't feel very good the next day, do you?\n\nBut we know in our country the difference between leadership and dictatorship, right?\n\nAnd the peaceful transition -- the peaceful transition of power is one of the things that sets us apart. It's how we hold our country together no matter who's in charge. You know, I went to 112 countries as your secretary of state and I -- I saw the difference between what we do and what others do, I was in countries where people jail their political opponents or execute them or exile them. Or invalidate elections that they didn't win.\n\nThat can never be allowed to happen here. I believe that's true no matter who you support in this election, whether or not you support me. Or you support my opponent, together, we must support American democracy and the country that has given every one of us so many opportunities.\n\nAnd the best way to do that, my friends, is to turn out and vote.\n\n\n\nThose are great. That is great. I'm excited because we are well on our way, there is an inspiring story being written right now by people across America, and many of you are getting involved in this election, some of you for the first time in your lives. We now have in America more than 200 million registered voters.\n\nThat is more than we have ever had in our entire history, and that is really good news for our democracy. More than 50 million millennials have registered.\n\nYou know what that means? Young people will determine the outcome of this election, which I think is good news. That means our future is in good hands.\n\nAnd listen to this, because this is really exciting. More than 4 million people have already voted.\n\nIncluding many people right here in Ohio.\n\nIn fact, in the first four days of in-person early voting here in Ohio, more people showed up to vote than they did at the same time in 2012, in our last election.\n\nThat is fantastic and it shows how serious people are taking this election. So numbers like that remind us that no matter all the negativity that's out there, there is something really exciting happening right now. People are coming together. Democrats, Republicans, independents, all of us to reject hate and division.\n\nPeople are motivated to vote early, to defend core American values, to embrace a future where every person counts, everyone has a place, and everyone can contribute. That is my vision. I have a hopeful, optimistic, unifying vision for what our country will be. Because from the beginning, our campaign has been focused on ideas, not insults, on bringing people together, not tearing us apart.\n\nAnd I want all of you to know that that is true not only for the campaign, but if I am fortunate enough to be your president, I want you to know, and I want you to tell anybody you know, any friends, or colleagues at school or work, or your neighborhood who may be planning to support the other guy, here is what I want you to tell them.\n\nI want you to tell them that I want to be their president. I want to be every single American's president, whether you agree or disagree, whether you vote for me or against me.\n\nI believe we can disagree without being disagreeable. I believe that. And I have seen that happen. I want to be a good listener. I know there are a lot of people here in Ohio who are discouraged, frustrated, even angry about what is going on in their lives, about losing jobs, they are upset about what they see happening around them. I get that.\n\nBut I think anger is not a plan. We need plans that will help us deal with the legitimate concerns and questions that people have here in Ohio. I think that is what the country needs now. And that is what I will try to offer.\n\n I am not going to pretend that we can just snap our fingers and solve our problems. That would not be fair. It wouldn't be true. But I know we can make progress together and you deserve something to vote for, not just against.\n\nSo I want to speak directly to the challenges that a lot of people here in Ohio face, especially when it comes to our economy. You see I believe really simply that when the middle class thrives, America thrives. When we build the economy from the middle out and the ground up, not from the top down, we are more likely to provide better lives, better incomes, better opportunities for more Americans.\n\nMy opponent has a different perspective. He really believes if you give trillions, that's with a T, trillions in tax cuts to the wealthy, to millionaires and billionaires and corporations, everything will work out. It's really trickle down on steroids. I believe differently that we must invest in working families in the middle class, in small businesses, that will power the economy.\n\nAnd that's what we're going to do. We're going to get the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top who have done pretty well over the last years. Now Donald likes to say he's on the side of American workers but his actions tell a different story. He has been buying cheap Chinese steel and aluminum for his construction projects when he should be buying good American made steel that supports good American jobs.\n\nAnd this is a very important issue here in Ohio because you're one of the largest steel producing states in America so you understand how important this is to support the American steel industry so I'm going to let Donald try to explain himself to the steel workers filing for unemployment. He has put Chinese steel workers to work, not American steel workers and we're going to change that.\n\nAnd for all of his talk about putting America first, he's made his products in at least 12 other countries. Trump's suits were made in Mexico. They could have been made in Brooklyn, Ohio. Trump's furniture is made in Turkey and it could have been made in Cleveland. Trump barware is made in Slovenia instead of Toledo. So if he wants to make America great again, why doesn't he start by making things in America again?\n\nAnd we also know that he hasn't paid a dime in federal income tax for years.\n\nHe says that makes him smart. Well, I don't know how smart you have to be to lose $1 billion in a year in the first place. But what that means is everybody else here, all of us, have paid more in federal income taxes than a billionaire, right? And that means he's contributed zero, zero for our military or our vets, zero for Pell grants to help young people go to college, zero for our highways or investing in clean energy or other ways to help us with new jobs for the future.\n\nNow Tim Kaine and I, we have a different view. We want to make the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II. Jobs in infrastructure and manufacturing, clean energy, technology and small business. We are going to make America the clean energy superpower of the 21st century.\n\nAnd I've set some big goals. I want us to deploy a half a billion more solar panels by the end of my first term.\n\nAnd enough clean energy to power every home within 10 years.\n\nWe're also going to strengthen education at every level starting with universal pre-kindergarten education.\n\nAnd we want good schools with good teachers in every zip code so that every kid gets a world class education. I want us to bring back technical education in high school. I think it was a mistake when we took it out of our high schools.\n\nAnd let's remember, it's at community colleges like this that thousands and thousands of people in our country, of all ages, get such a good start.\n\nAnd I'm going to make public colleges and universities tuition free for any families making less than $125,000 a year.\n\nEducation should lift you up, not hold you back. And we're going to help you, we're going to help you pay back and pay down your loans. Too many young people are burdened by those debts.\n\nIt's going to be great to help you pay it back as a percentage of your income, so you're never on the hook for more than you can afford. Senator Bernie Sanders and I worked on this plan together.\n\nIt's going to help save millions of people thousands of dollars, and you can actually go to HillaryClinton.com\/calculator to see how much money you and your family could save with our plan.\n\nI also want to do more for apprenticeship programs. I thank all the unions represented here for the great apprentice programs that you have in place. Thank you.\n\nI want to support apprenticeship programs and skills trainings with business and labor unions, because there are going to be good jobs out there for welders, and machinists, and health technicians, and computer coders, and so much more. I want everybody to have the chance to get your piece of the American dream, and I think the American dream is big enough for everybody.\n\nAnd we're going to raise the national minimum wage because no one who works full-time should still be in poverty.\n\nAs I said in the debate the other night, I want to make sure that we take care of people on Social Security who were low-income workers and women, particularly widows, who lose have of their monthly payment when their husbands die.\n\nWe've got to do more to make sure Social Security provides a decent income for our seniors. And, yes, don't you think it's finally time to guarantee equal pay for women's work?\n\nNow the equal pay issue is important in and of itself because, if you've got a mother or a wife or a daughter or a sister who's working, you want her to be paid fairly. I mean that's good for the entire family, right?\n\nBut the equal pay issue gets at something even deeper. We've got to make sure that women and girls are treated with the dignity and respect in our country that they deserve.\n\nWe cannot -- we cannot tolerate the kind of behavior and language we've seen from my opponent. He thinks that belittling women makes him bigger. Goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and I don't think there's a woman anywhere who doesn't know how that feels.\n\nSo we're going to stand up for everybody, men and women, retirees, the young, millennials, everybody deserves to be treated with respect and dignity.\n\nAnd I have said repeatedly that we're going to reform the criminal justice system so that it works fairly for everyone. And we have to address systemic racism that is still too big a part of our lives together.\n\nI want to give credit to all the young people, and really people of all ages, who've been marching and speaking out, doing everything you can to make sure that issues of policing and mass incarceration, environmental justice, economic justice, educational equity, gun violence, voting rights, that they get the attention they deserve. Because it's important that we lift these issues up and work to make sure that everybody in our country feels like they are seen and they are heard. And all the advocates and activists who have challenged us to think about these issues of race and justice and equality and opportunity in new and powerful ways really deserve our appreciation.\n\nI'm going to do everything I can to lift these issues up, because one of my hopes for my presidency will be to root out systemic racism and bigotry and discrimination in whatever form it takes.\n\nSo really, when you think about it, my name will be on the ballot, but it is not just me. People say, well, she has lots of plans and all of that. I do, but I also have a lot of humility about this.\n\nI really believe our country is at a turning point, that this is a crossroads election. So yes, my name may be on the ballot, but the question really is, who are we as a country? What are our values? What kind of future do we want to create together?\n\nIt is so easy to get cynical about politics, believe me, I know that. But this matters so deeply to our families and our communities and our country, and indeed our world.\n\nSo I want to say something to people who may be reconsidering their support for my opponent. I know you may still have questions for me. I respect that, I want to answer them, I want to earn your vote.\n\nI am reaching out to all Americans, Democrats, Republicans and independents. I think America needs every single one of us to bring our energy and our talents, our ambition to build that better country.\n\nSo I hope that as we move through these next 18 days, everyone thinks seriously about what you really want to see, not just in your next president, but in your lives, in your jobs, in your education, in our future together.\n\nAnd the only way we can have that positive, optimistic, unifying future is if all of you help us get there. Every phone call you make, every door you knock on, every voter you register makes a big difference.\n\nSo I hope you will give whatever time you can for these last days. You can go to hillaryclinton.com and sign up to volunteer. You can text \"JOIN,\" J-O-I-N, to 47246 to join. With your help, we can elect Democrats up and down the ballot starting with Ted Strickland and others who are running.\n\nRemember that early in-person voting in Ohio began on October 12th and it ends on November 7th. So you have more of a window to vote than a lot of people in other states.\n\nAnd I hope you will exercise that. And I hope that you will decide whatever issue you care about, you can almost in your mind's eye see that on the ballot, see it next to my name, see it whether you care about climate change and what we are doing to protect the Great Lakes, including Lake Eerie, while creating good paying clean energy jobs.\n\nWhether you believe women should be able to make our own health care decisions.\n\nIf you believe marriage equality should be protected.\n\nAnd that LGBT Americans should be treated equally.\n\nIf you believe we should do more to stop the opioid epidemic that is destroying lives and communities.\n\nThat we should do more to help with mental health and make sure that people get the treatment that they deserve.\n\nIf you believe we need to get the cost of health care, premiums, co-pays, deductibles, and prescription drug costs down.\n\nIf you believe that we should have a foreign policy where we work with our allies, not insult them, and achieve common goals toward peace and prosperity.\n\nThis is our chance to send a very clear, unmistakable message about what kind of country and future we want.\n\nYou know, I have two of the most wonderful grandchildren ever, and I see them whenever I can, I FaceTime with them all the time.\n\nBut I think about them endlessly because I feel such a sense of responsibility, not just because they're my grandchildren, obviously, and I would do anything to help them, but because I want everybody's children and grandchildren to have the same opportunities, to chart your own future, to believe in yourself, to contribute to this great America democracy of ours.\n\nTo be part on an economy that lifts you up, not drags you down. I am motivated by my work that I've done my entire life on behalf of kids and families.\n\nFrom the time I joined the Children's Defense Fund, until today. And I will do whatever I can to make it my mission to give every single person, especially every child and young person, the chance to live up to your God-given potential.\n\nLet's go out and prove that love trumps hate. Thank you!\u0000","28":"In 21 days, we are going to win the state of Colorado and we're going to win the White House. We're going to take it back. \nAnd while I'm at it, make sure you mail in those ballots before election day. Early voting starts on the 24th, you've got to mail them in. But get there, November 8th.\n\nI'd like to also start today by recognizing the incredible military contributions of Colorado Springs, a place I actually know very well. One of the most beautiful places, by the way. We have such amazing people working at Fort Carson, Peterson Air Force Base, the United States Space Command, NORAD, Schriever Air Force Base and the United States Air Force Academy. Good place. \n\nI've got many friends that went to the Air Force Academy, all very smart. They love their airplanes, that I can tell you. The courage and selflessness of our service members and their devotion to each other and to their country are the traits that we need to make America great again. \n\nGreat people. Together, we're going to deliver real change that puts America first. You don't hear that term very much. We don't hear that term very much anymore, do we? America first, right? If I win, it's going to be America first every single time, that I can tell you. Believe me. \n\nWe're going to end the government corruption and we're going to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C. \n\nWe are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals, end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees from other countries, reduce surging crime, cut taxes big league and end regulations. \n\nUnleash job-producing American energy, rebuild our great military, which sadly has become very depleted, but the greatest people on Earth. We're going to take care of our veterans like they have never been taken care of before. And repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare. \n\nYour jobs will come back under a Trump administration. Your incomes will go up under a Trump administration. Your taxes will go down under a Trump administration. \n\nYour country and I tell you, your country is so proud of you, but right now we have to help our country. We have to help our country. It is under siege in so many ways. By the way, you could almost stay, especially from the dishonest media, that's for sure. \n\nVery dishonest. Your companies won't be leaving Colorado under a Trump administration. They'll be expanding and there will be new companies coming in. Right now, we're not growing at all as a nation. You look at our jobs report, a disaster. Last week a jobs report, total disaster. Look at our GNP, total disaster.\n\nUnder my plan, we're going to grow at 4 percent. Right now, we're at about 1 percent. \n\nChina's at 7 percent. India's at 8 percent. We're at 1 percent and it's going to be going down if we keep if Hillary Clinton gets in, you will set record lows, believe me. That I can tell you. \n\nWe're going to create at least 25 million new jobs in 10 years. And by the way, did you see the protesters yesterday, where they call them. The protesters are paid a lot of money by the DNC. And I kept saying, I wonder why those people are here? Because they never seem to have much on their mind, other than stand up and protest.\n\nAnd yesterday it came out, but it was barely covered by the media. But it's all over the media. They were busted. They were paid $1,500 each and were given cell phones go up and disturb Trump rallies. And I sort of always knew it, in Chicago, even last night. We had people stand up for no reason. It's like, what are they doing here? And can you imagine, that's a big story, hardly covered by the media. \n\nSo bad. We're also going to create a new government that answers to the people. Hillary Clinton--Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to run for the presidency. \n\nShe shouldn't be allowed to run for the presidency after what she's done. I'll tell you. It's true. Newly released, two days ago, FBI documents reveal just how deep the corruption goes. The undersecretary of state, Patrick Kennedy, illegally pressured the FBI to unclassify e-mails from Hillary Clinton's illegal server. \n\nIt's hard to believe. And nothing happens to her, folks, and nothing ever happens. In other words, the State Department was trying to cover up Hillary's crime of sending classified information on a server our enemies could easily access. \n\nThe FBI document show that Patrick Kennedy made the request for altering classification as part of a very, very serious quid pro quo. Not allowed to do it. This is a felony corruption. Yesterday, I said Undersecretary Kennedy must immediately resign. \n\nThe media barely covers this event, by the way. \n\nThis is a bigger event than Watergate and they practically refuse to cover it. Today, I'm calling for him to be fired. \n\nClinton and her cronies have sacrificed your security, your family's safety and your country's safety as though it meant nothing at all to her. \n\nRemember also that Hillary lied under oath to Congress, saying that she never sent or received classified information on her secret server. Right? She never received it on that insecure server, that she should have never been allowed to have. That you're not allowed to have. And pretended not to know. Remember this one: that the letter \"C\" meant confidential information was classified. \n\nShe thought it was the lettering of a paragraph. \n\nThere's never been a time in our country's history where anything like this has gone on. And the FBI, there must be people in there, based on what you read, that are ashamed of what's happened. And the Department of Justice, there must be people in there that are ashamed, absolutely ashamed of what's been going on.\n\nHillary then told the FBI she couldn't remember 39 times. And then in written testimony last week, under oath, she said that she couldn't remember another 21 times. Bad memory. She's got a terrible memory. \n\nThis elaborate, criminal cover up included Hillary's deleting and bleaching of 33,000 e-mails. The disappearance of 13 iPhones, some by hammers, two boxes of e-mail evidence gone missing, that was as of last week. Can you imagine they're now missing on top of everything else, two boxes of e-mails? And the destruction of laptops, in a secret deal with the FBI. \n\nThis truly is, and I said it, this truly is many times worse than Watergate. And we're going to put an end to it on November 8th. \n\nGoing to do it. \n\nAnother series of leaked e-mails show top officials in the Clinton campaign scheming to take massive sums of money from registered foreign lobbyists. And then you wonder why we do so badly. But you don't hear the media talking about that at all, do you? You don't see it at all. As WikiLeaks proved, the media, is merely, and it truly is, it's just an extension of the Clinton campaign. \n\nThe press has created a rigged system and poisoned the mind of so many of our voters. They have rigged it from the beginning by telling totally false stories. Most recently about phony allegations where I have been under constant attack. They attack my business. I built a great business but, although most people do admit that. They attacked my wonderful family. They attacked my temperament.\n\nBut I built an incredible company, those papers are filed. And I'm fortunate to have a beautiful and loving family. You all saw Melania last night on television. Did a great job. \n\nThat she even has to do that is a shame. And my temperament has always been just about my greatest strength. We have a winning temperament. Our country doesn't win anymore. We don't win anymore. This is an election about truth. And you're not going to get it from the dishonest media.\n\nSome people can't handle the truth. No matter what people may think of me, the one thing they know is that we're going to tell the American people where we stand, where we are. We're going to tell them the truth. \n\nNow even though we're doing pretty good in the polls, I don't believe the polls anymore. I don't believe them. I don't believe them. And if there's 10, and if there's one or two bad ones, that's the only one they show.\n\nBelieve me, folks, we're doing great. If we keep our spirit, and if we go out and win, this is another Brexit, believe me. They are so worried. That's why they've become vicious and hostile and dirty because they see what's going on. This rally set up just a short while ago; look at the number of people, packed. But every rally is the same way. \n\nAt her rallies, very few people show up, when she has the energy to go to the event. Which isn't often. She's doing debate prep. She did so much debate prep. Did we beat her badly in that second debate? \n\nSort of funny. She's been doing this for 30 years. Now she has to do debate prep for five days. You know what the debate prep is? It's resting. It's lying down, going to sleep. I think the media's trying to discourage our people from going out to vote. And it was just brought up to me by a reporter in the back.\n\nThey said, you know, it's very interesting, when you were fighting 17 people, the media was nasty, but they really got nasty when we started to take the lead in the polls. They said, \"Wait a minute, this thing's going to happen. It's going to happen.\"\n\nChange stop our jobs from leaving, our companies from leaving, strengthen our military, preserve our Second Amendment. They're saying, this is going to happen. And it is true. Made up stories. They're liars and made up stories.\n\nWithout the media and all of the other corrupt entities that have helped her along the way, she would be nothing. She would be nothing. She really--she would be doing so badly. Even my worst critics agree that the media has come after us like they have never come after anyone before. It's my badge of honor.\n\nI mean, you know, what am I going to do? Even the New York Times, which is totally dishonest, by the way--here's the good news about the New York Times. They won't be in business much longer. Do you see what they're losing? \n\nThey are dying. They are dying. And they're dying also because they're very dishonest. But one of their biggest columnist-reporters wrote a story about how bad it is. He said, let's face it--this is in the New York Times \"balance has been on vacation since Mr. Trump stepped onto this golden Trump Tower escalator to announce his candidacy.\"\n\nCan you believe that? They're admitting it. They don't even care. It actually said that we don't care. They will do anything to stop what we're doing. Not me, it's what we're doing. It's an agenda. It's going to agenda of change. But we won't let them stop maybe the greatest movement in the history of our country.\n\nHistory is watching us now, waiting to see if we will rise to the moment. We have to rise. We have to do it. We're under tremendous opposition. We have the greatest people in the world. That's what I've learned. Somebody said, what's the most important thing you learned? How great the American people are. I've gone all over the country.\n\nI have two things I've learned that, and I've learned how totally dishonest the media is. It's so dishonest. I've learned that, too. They are the most dishonest people I've ever dealt with. Not all of them, but, honestly, like 75 percent. Some are very good, but for the most part, yes.\n\nWe have stories that we think are going to unbelievable stories. They turn out--they make them as bad as possible. We have stories on the other side that would normally dismantle a campaign, and they don't even report them. It's a disgrace. What's going on is a disgrace.\n\nBut we've only just begun to fight, believe me. We have three weeks. You know what, we have three weeks. And I hear we're going great in Colorado. My people in back said, \"You're going to win Colorado, doesn't matter what they say.\" \n\nGet out and vote. But they even want to try and rig the election at the polling booths where so many cities are corrupt. And you see that. And voter fraud is all too common. And then they criticize us for saying that. And we have even Republicans, \"Oh, that's such a terrible thing to say.\"\n\nWell, take a look at Philadelphia, what's been going on. Take a look at Chicago, take a look at St. Louis. Take a look at some of these cities where you see things happening that are horrendous. And if you talk about them, they say bad things about you. They call you a racist. They call you all--and by the way, speaking of that, nobody will do more for the African-American citizens of this country than Donald Trump, nobody, nobody. Nobody will do more for the Latino community than Donald Trump, I can tell you.\n\nIn 2014, the Washington Post, another beauty, published an article entitled, \"Could Non-Citizens Decide the November Election?\" The article found that 14 percent of non-citizens were registered to vote, 14 percent were registered to vote. And we're not supposed to talk about it. And your Republican leaders said, \"Oh, this--everything is peachy-dory,\" right? And it also found non-citizen voting may have given Democrats the pivotal sixtieth vote needed to pass Obamacare. It's a Washington policy, not me.\n\nThe system is also rigged by the donors giving hundreds of millions of dollars to Crooked Hillary's campaign. It's rigged. It's a bad system. The reason Hillary Clinton pushes for NAFTA--or the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will also be a disaster--NAFTA's the worst trade deal ever signed, ever made, by anybody in the world.\n\nWe're a one-way highway out. We get the drugs, right? We get the drugs. We get the unemployment. We get the empty factories. Mexico and other countries get the cash. They get the employment. They get the plants.\n\nAnd for completely open borders--she wants completely open borders, is because her international donors control her every move. If we let Crooked Hillary's cartel and--and just remember this--run this government, history will record that 2017 was the year that America lost, truly lost, its independence, truly lost its independence.\n\nAnd by the way, this is our final shot, folks. In four years, it's over. You're never going to be able to win. You're never going to be able to win. It's tilting. It's going to be a one-party system. This is your final shot for the Supreme Court, for your Second Amendment. I mean, this is your final shot, November 8th.\n\nSo hopefully you'll do what you know you have to do. Get out of bed and vote. No matter how you're feeling, no matter how you're feeling.\n\nIt is indeed time to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C. This is why I'm proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again. First, I'm going to institute a five-year ban on all executive branch officials lobbying the government after they leave government service, right?\n\nSecond, I'm going to ask Congress to institute its own five-year ban on lobbying by former members of Congress and their staffs. That's a simple one. And they know this should be done, but they're not going to do it, but they'll do it if I get in.\n\nI'm going to, number three, expand the definition of lobbyists so that we close all the loopholes that former government officials use by labeling themselves \n\nRight? I've been talking about that for years. Decades of failure in Washington and decades of special interest dealing must and will come to an end. And remember, by the time this ends, I will have spent over $100 million on my campaign. Hillary's spent nothing. She gets all her money from the special interest donors. And my interest is you; my interest is you. \n\nWe have to break the cycle of corruption, and we have to give new voices to change. And we have to--we have no--do we have a choice? So that we can have a government that works again and can function properly, which our government doesn't right now, including giving Iran $1.7 billion in cash. \n\nAnd remember the deportation of 800 people? Turned out to be 800 people, then went to 1,800 people.\n\nAnd they were going to be deported for good reason. You know, if our country deports somebody, they've got to be pretty, pretty out there. Well, they pressed the wrong button, and congratulations, we have 1,800 new citizens of the United States.\n\nAnd when I said, \"undo it,\" they said that wouldn't be constitutional. Hey, folks, how stupid are we being led? The time for congressional term limits has finally arrived. Not only will it end our government corruption, but we will end the economic stagnation that we're in right now. No growth.\n\nMy plan for the economy can be summed up in three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs. It will happen. \n\nAt the center of our historic jobs plan will be fixing our terrible trade deals, which I've wanted to do from the beginning; 47 million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are living right now on food stamps. It's hard to believe this is our country.\n\nWe have nearly an $800 billion annual trade deficit in goods with the world. And the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression. Do you know that? The worst since the Great Depression. Colorado has lost one in seven manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton signed NAFTA, and a deal supported by Hillary Clinton very strongly.\n\nAnd this I thought was a typographical error, because I figured they meant 700 or 7,000, but it wasn't: We've lost 70,000 factories since China's entry into the World Trade Organization. Another Bill and Hillary backed disaster.\n\nWe are living through the greatest job theft in the history of the world. More jobs have been stolen from our country, so stupidly we let them go. We let our companies go so foolishly. We don't know what we're doing. A Trump administration is going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to the foreign cheating, and stop the jobs from leaving our country, and have jobs come back in the other direction. \n\nAs part of our plan to bring back our jobs, we're going to lower our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent. \n\nWe are right now the highest-taxed nation in the world. That's one of the reasons our companies are leaving. We're also going to fix our inner cities--45 percent of African-American children, under the age of six are living in poverty; 58 percent of African-American youth are not working. Almost 3,500 people have been shot in the city of Chicago.\n\nCan you believe this? Since January 1st. The national murder rate has experienced the largest single year increase in more than 45 years. Can you believe that? Murder, highest rate in 45 years.\n\nSo you don't--they don't seem to. She said, \"nobody cares.\" And you're right, they don't seem too. So to those African-Americans suffering, to those Latinos suffering, I say: What do you have to lose? Elect Donald Trump. I will fix it. We will fix it. \n\nWe will fix it. We're going to get a very big African-American vote. We're going to get a very big Latino vote. Because the Democrats come in, they want your vote. And as soon as you give them the vote, they say, \"See you in four years.\" They don't do anything. It's gotten worse and worse for both the African-Americans, the Latino-Hispanics. It's gotten worse and it will only get worse.\n\nThey want your vote. Hillary Clinton said she was going to fix up the state of New York when she ran for the Senate. It is a total disaster. We will be a rich nation once again. But to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country. \n\nOur national security begins at the border. Speaking in secret, to a foreign bank \n\nI promise, we will build the wall. \n\nHillary Clinton said her dream is for total open trade. There go your jobs; and open borders--there goes your country. Simple as that.\n\nThere are already a record 65 million people in the United States who speak a language other than English. It's in their interest and everyone's interest to control immigration so past arrivals can integrate into society and really join the middle class and the upper class.\n\nBut in a secret speech to Goldman Sachs, she said, \"Citizens who want to control immigration are un-American.\" In other words, if you want to have a border, you want to have a wall, which creates a country. Even if you want people to come in, but come in through a legal process, she considers that un-American. So Hillary thinks most of the country is either deplorable, irredeemable, un-American, racist, or basement dwellers in the case of the Bernie Sanders people. She said they were basement dwellers. Hillary's plan includes an open border with the Middle East, meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within our shores.\n\nWe will be the great Trojan horse folks. As sure as you're standing there. Just today, an Iraqi refugee approved for entry by Hillary Clinton's State Department pled guilty to joining ISIS. He entered as a refugee in November of 2009. And then we approved for a green card in 2011. It's one of hundreds of examples of the United States voluntarily admitting people from the world's most dangerous places who turn out to be terrorists.\n\nSo let me state this as clearly as I can. If I'm elected president of the United States, I am going to keep radical Islamic terrorist the hell out of our country. We have enough problems. \n\nWe have enough problems. We've got big problems: $20 trillion in debt. We have problems like you wouldn't believe. We'll also stop the crisis of illegal immigration. A Trump administration will secure and defend our borders. And we will build that wall and Mexico will pay for that wall. \n\nWe just got the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol Office. First time they've ever done it. ICE was just last week. As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be released because their home countries would not take them back. They were too evil. They were too evil drug lords, heads of gangs. I mean these people were evil. They wouldn't take them back.\n\nSo we come over, we bring, they won't take them back. Oh, take them back, drop them on the streets. And then you wonder why the murder rate is the highest in 45 years and other things.\n\nThe ICE officer described Hillary's proposal as quote, \"The most radical immigration proposal in U.S. history.\" Here's a summary of the Hillary plan. She wants to support sanctuary cities.\n\nShe wants Social Security, Medicare and lifetime welfare for illegal immigrants by making them all citizens. They get taken care of better than our great vets. That won't happen. She wants Obamacare for illegal immigrants. Obamacare is not going to be here much longer, folks. You see what's going on. Regardless. No deportation of Visa overstays. Expanding catch-and-release on the border. She wants it expanded. In other words, catch them and say, \"Oh, you can go.\"\n\nExpanding President Obama's unconstitutional executive amnesty, including instant work permits for millions of illegal workers. Freeing even--there go your jobs--freeing even more criminal aliens by expanding Obama's non-enforcement directives.\n\nAnd this is to me, the beauty of them all. Obama has allowed thousands and thousands and thousands of people to come in, Syrians from the Middle East. She wants an increase of 550 percent in Syrian refugees into our country. \n\nEither we win this election, or we lose our country. Under a Trump administration, it's going to be America first. \n\nHere are some of the amazing things we're going to do for our country starting in 2017. We're so close. We have to get it over the line. We're so close. Forget the press. Read the internet, study other things, don't go for the mainstream media. Most of them--good news--fortunately most of them won't be around very much longer, in my opinion. They're going down. Financially, big trouble. A lot of big trouble. They've got a lot of big trouble. That's good.\n\nWe're going to have--and I do get a lot of honesty over the internet. You do get some dishonesty, too, but at least you can separate it. We should have a choice. We're going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan and maybe even bigger. We're going to eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation. We are going to defend religious liberty, provide school choice to every low- income child in America. And get rid of common core so that we can have education locally. \n\nWe are going to support the men and women of law enforcement. \n\nLaw and order and justice. Law and order and justice. We are going to save something that is under tremendous stress. We're going to save your Second Amendment. \n\nAnd we're going to appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. \n\nYou have 21 days to make every dream you've ever dreamed for you family, for your grandchildren, for you children, for yourself, for your country to come true. Our campaign is powered by our love for this country and our love for our fellow citizens. There's a lot of love in this room. A lot of love. And we don't want a divided country. We want to bring other people. We want to love everybody in our country. It's a campaign about rejecting the cynicism and the elitism of our failed political establishment. On November 8th, the arrogance of Washington, D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter. That's you, and you.\n\nI am going to fight so hard for every citizen, of every background, for every single stretch of this nation. I am going to fight for every child living in poverty. I'm going to fight for every mom whose lost her child to illegal immigration and drugs and gang violence, and the viciousness that it all builds.\n\nI'm going to fight for every community whose jobs and factories have turned into dust. And those jobs and factories are not with us any more. They're in other countries, making everybody rich but us. \n\nI'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people, not the donors and the special interests. \n\nAnd with all the money she made, she doesn't put up any money into her own campaign. That's pretty remarkable. I'm doing it. I'm going to fight to bring us all together. We're not going to be divided anymore as Americans. Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people, under one God, saluting one American flag. \n\nThank you. In 10 years, in 20 years, in 30 years, you're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this beautiful day in this great state and in this truly great country. This is a movement that they have never seen before. They've never seen anything like this before. There has never been like this before.\n\nYou're going to look back at this election and say, \"This is by far the most important vote, you've ever cast, for anyone at any time.\" \n\nOnce again, we're going to have a government of, by, and for the people. \n\nYou will see, and be so proud of your country again and hopefully you'll be so proud of your president again. \n\nWe will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again.\n\nThank you, everybody. God bless you. November 8th, go out and vote. November 8th. God bless you, everybody. \u0000","29":"It is so great to be back in Florida, my second home. Let me also thank our good and dear friend, Chairman Jeff Miller, for joining us here today. We've worked closely together on developing much-needed reforms to take care of our Veterans.\nLet me open by making this very important declaration: I love this state, I love the people of this state, and together we are going to have an amazing victory in November.\n\nDecades of political failure and corruption will come swiftly to an end, and a New American Future will begin.\n\nThe citizens of this country will be in charge once more.\n\nThe special interests have had their day. That chapter in our history is closing.\n\nThe history book is closing on the failed politicians of yesterday. A new chapter is beginning, and this chapter will be authored by you, the American people.\n\nThis will be your time. You will be running the show. Not the donors, not the insiders, not the media executives.\n\nOnce more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.\n\nAll we have to do is cut our ties to the bitter failures of the past, and anything becomes possible.\n\nChange is coming.\n\nAll the people who've rigged the system for their own personal benefit are trying to stop our change campaign because they know that their gravy train has reached its last stop.\n\nIt's your turn now. This is your time.\n\nThe fact that so many encrusted old political insiders oppose our campaign is the best proof you will ever need that we are fighting for real change - not partisan change.\n\nWe are fighting for all Americans - Democrats, Republicans, Independents, Conservatives, Liberals - who've been failed by this corrupt system. We're fighting for everyone who doesn't have a voice.\n\nWe're also fighting for every region of this country. For every part of Florida, and every part of America. From Pensacola to Pittsburgh, from Baltimore to Baton Rouge, we are fighting for every last city and every last person in this country.\n\nHillary Clinton is the candidate of the past.\n\nOurs is the campaign of the future.\n\nIn this future, we are going to pursue new trade policies that put American workers first - and that keep jobs in our country. All the people who got NAFTA wrong, and China wrong, and who are trying to give us the Trans-Pacific Partnership - are the same failed voices pushing for Hillary Clinton.\n\nOur trade deficit with the world is now nearly $800 billion dollars. We've lost one-third of our manufacturing jobs since Bill and Hillary Clinton gave us NAFTA. China is manipulating its currency and taking our jobs. We are going to stop companies from leaving our country and keep those jobs right here in America. The era of economic surrender is over.\n\nWe will also have a very strong border that stops people and drugs from illegally pouring into our country -- and we're going to build a border wall, and Mexico will pay for it.\n\nIn this new future, we are going to raise your wages. Household incomes are over $4,000 less today than they were in the year 2000.\n\nMy tax, trade, energy, immigration and regulation reforms will get your salaries and wages up. Hillary Clinton will continue the failed economic agenda that has only made her friends rich at your personal expense. Many people in this room tonight, and across this country, haven't seen a real wage increase in 18 years.\n\nThe people getting rich off of our rigged system have sent tens of millions of dollars to Hillary Clinton - much of it to her personal bank account - to keep you from having the future you deserve.\n\nBut on November 8th, you get to vote for the future you want.\n\nIn this future, we are going to pursue new education policies. At the center of my plan is school choice. I want every disadvantaged child in America to be able to attend the public or private school that is right for them and their family.\n\nIn this future, we are also going to keep our country out of the endless wars that have defined Hillary Clinton's career.\n\nTo keep our country out of war, we will remember those three very famous words: Peace Through Strength.\n\nThat means rebuilding our badly depleted military. I laid out a detailed plan this week to re-invest in our military and our troops.\n\nWe are going to build a 350 ship Navy, a 540,000 soldier Army, an Air Force of 1,200 combat-ready fighter jets, and a Marine Core built on 36 Battalions. Crucially, we are also going to pursue a state-of-the-art missile defense.\n\nWe will start by modernizing our cruisers to provide the Ballistic Missile Defense capability our nation needs.\n\nAs we expand our Navy toward the goal of 350 ships, we will also procure additional modern destroyers that are designed to handle the missile defense mission in the coming years.\n\nJust today we were reminded of the need for missile defense after North Korea performed its fourth nuclear test since Hillary Clinton became Secretary of State.\n\nOne more massive Hillary Clinton failure.\n\nJust like she failed in Iran and put them on the path to nuclear weapons.\n\nHillary Clinton has presided over the greatest series of foreign policy failures and blunders anyone has ever seen. Her policies have produced massive global disorder.\n\nShe handed Iraq over to ISIS, unleashing that terror group onto the world. ISIS would not be threatening the West today if not for the decisions Hillary Clinton made.\n\nShe helped destabilize Egypt by supporting the ouster of President Mubarak in exchange for the Muslim Brotherhood. Fortunately, President El-Sisi is now in charge, but terrorists have gained a foothold in that country.\n\nShe helped push Syria into a prolonged civil war by pushing regime change in that country too - without any plan for the day after.\n\nShe failed with China, which has only grown more aggressive. By the way, she also let China steal hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property.\n\nAnd of course, Hillary Clinton failed with her Russian Reset. She gave up missile defense in Poland and the Czech Republic in exchange for nothing in return. Then, she gave up 20% of U.S. uranium to Russia -while those who benefited from the deal gave money to the Clintons.\n\nLet's not forget, Russia went into Crimea on President Obama's watch.\n\nUnlike Clinton and Obama, we will negotiate with Russia from a position of strength - not weakness. And weakness is all we get from President Obama and Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe difference between me and my opponent on Vladimir Putin, and in all negotiations, is that I negotiate by creating leverage so I can extract a good deal for the United States.\n\nHillary Clinton negotiates but never gets anything of value for the United States. Putin laughs at our leaders, and takes them to the cleaners again and again.\n\nThat is why we will rebuild our military, strengthen our economy, and regain our position of leadership in the world - so we can negotiate from a position of great strength once again.\n\nIf I cannot get a good deal for the United States, I will follow the example of Ronald Reagan and walk away. That is completely contrary to the way President Obama and Hillary Clinton negotiate which gets nothing of value for the United States, ever. They just keep losing.\n\nI will end this legacy of failure and strongly defend the interests of the United States.\n\nBut I will also keep focused on the ultimate goal. We will not seek endless conflict and hostility; we won't get trapped in the failed approaches of the past. A future where America can find common ground with countries like Russia and China is a better future for our children.\n\nWe will pursue these relationships with our eyes wide open, and a clear understanding of our many, many differences. I will advocate the American position with a strength and clarity President Obama and Hillary Clinton never have. No more apology tours. No more bowing to foreign powers. We proudly defend America at every single turn.\n\nAmerica will get the respect it deserves.\n\nAnd if we don't, I will walk away from the deal like you've never seen anyone walk before. And, believe me, within a short while, they will come back -- but only on my terms, therefore the terms of the American people.\n\nOn these principles, we will pursue our long-term goals of peace - for the sake of our kids, and for the sake of the world's future.\n\nHillary Clinton has failed in every single country where she has ever gotten involved, and at a very high price for the world.\n\nHer policies have produced only death and destruction, not diplomacy. She's trigger-happy, pushing recklessly for regime change - but never creating or promoting stability, or advancing the core interests of the United States.\n\nHer only real achievement as Secretary of State has been getting away with her massive email scandal. She bleached, deleted and destroyed her emails after a subpoena from Congress.\n\nShe lied to Congress while under oath, and smashed her phones with a hammer to keep them from getting to authorities.\n\nBy the way, who has thirteen phones in the first place? Only somebody with a whole lot to hide.\n\nAnd we all know what Hillary Clinton was hiding. She was hiding her pay-for-play scandals as Secretary of State.\n\nHillary Clinton isn't just part of the corrupt establishment, she is the corrupt establishment.\n\nI just saw her press conference today where Hillary Clinton complained about all of the problems in the world. If only we'd had a competent Secretary of State who could have prevented all of these problems from happening.\n\nThroughout it all, Hillary Clinton and her Foundation raked in millions and millions of dollars from the most oppressive and brutal regimes on earth. Hillary Clinton and her Foundation have cozied up to regimes that oppress and brutalize women, that murder gays, and that violate human rights on an unimaginable scale.\n\nMy Administration will be a voice for all people who are oppressed, including the millions of women being oppressed by Radical Islam.\n\nHillary Clinton has been there for 30 years and produced only failure. Yet people keep giving her money and protecting her.\n\nIt's the powerful protecting the powerful.\n\nThe insiders fighting for insiders.\n\nI am fighting for you.\n\nAll the people advising Hillary Clinton are the people responsible for the endless wars and conflicts, and the tragedies in the Middle East.\n\nI am proud to have the support of the retired generals and admirals who know how to win - and how to avoid endless war.\n\nLet me also take this moment to express our deepest thanks and gratitude to everyone who has worn the uniform, but most especially to those who have given the ultimate sacrifice for this country.\n\nThere is no greater expression of love than the love shown by the men and women who have laid down their lives for their country and its people.\n\nIt is our duty to ensure that their sacrifices are not in vain. That means we don't issue timetables for political reasons, but that we work with our generals and our leaders to produce a real plan for victory.\n\nWe will pursue a new, steady foreign policy that seeks to advance the national security interests of the United States - not a reckless, interventionist globalism that has failed this country so badly.\n\nAnd we will be clear in naming our enemy: Radical Islamic Terrorism.\n\nThe fact that Hillary Clinton can't even say these words proves how unfit she is to lead this country. This is one single fact she can never escape.\n\nAny country that shares our goal of defeating this enemy will be our partner in this mission.\n\nWe will break the cycle of regime change, and refugee crisis, that has gone on for so many years.\n\nWe simply can't afford to continue down the road we are on right now.\n\nThat applies to everything.\n\nChange is needed at every single level of our society.\n\nWhen I talk about making America Great Again, I'm talking about creating a future that includes each and every American.\n\nI want the most inclusive, generous and prosperous society we have ever had.\n\nThe possibilities for our future are unlimited.\n\nThe Hillary Clinton campaign is so small, so petty, so tired.\n\nIf we just break from this bitter, divisive past, we can achieve anything.\n\nThat also means breaking from the lies and the deceit of the Clintons. They want to scare you out of voting for change. The most recent smear comes from Bill Clinton, who said that the theme of Make America Great Again is somehow racist - now they've unearthed video footage of Bill Clinton repeatedly using this same phrase. It's just one more Clinton lie, one more desperate slander to keep the people from having the future they deserve.\n\nWhen I talk about Making America Great Again, I'm talking about making it Great Again for Everyone - but especially for all of the Americans who have been left behind.\n\nWe are the campaign of unity, and we will deliver amazing things for all of our people.\n\nNew schools, new factories, new infrastructure.\n\nBeautiful skyscrapers will rise all across this nation. We will develop Detroit, Not Beijing.\n\nMost importantly, we will fight to end the systemic poverty in our inner cities, and to lift millions of African-Americans and Hispanics out of poverty.\n\nHere, in Florida, we have such an amazing and diverse community of Hispanic-Americans - from Cuba, from Puerto Rico, from Venezuela, from Haiti, from all over.\n\nThese incredible Americans will have in Donald J. Trump a President who is determined to fight for their jobs, their wages, their schools, and their futures.\n\nTo all Hispanic-Americans who want better jobs and higher wages: I will be your champion.\n\nAll working people, of all backgrounds and from all places, will have a true friend in Donald Trump.\n\nIn particular, I have a very special place in my heart for those who make a living as tradesmen, craftsmen and construction workers.\n\nI've spent my professional life among construction workers, bricklayers, electricians and plumbers. I feel more comfortable around blue collar workers than Wall Street executives. There's a reason the hedge fund managers are funding Hillary Clinton's campaign, and not mine.\n\nMy campaign is powered by my own money, but also small dollar donations from people like all of you who just want their country back.\n\nThis is our chance. It's our last chance to give the people control over their own futures once again.\n\nGleaming new plants stretching across our nation.\n\nYoung Latino children getting an amazing education at the school of their choice - and their parents having their jobs protected from unfair competition.\n\nOur Veterans will get the best healthcare in the world. You can read the whole plan on our website, DonaldJTrump.com.\n\nMassive tax reductions and tax simplification - so that you can keep more of your precious time and your hard-earned money. Hillary Clinton wants to raise your taxes big time.\n\nMost importantly, 2017 will be about unity.\n\nOnce again, we will be One American Nation.\n\nWe Will Be One American People.\n\nJust imagine what we can accomplish together if we set aside our differences, and focus on what we have in common as Americans.\n\nWe will be one people, living under One God, saluting one beautiful American Flag.\n\nWe Will Make America Proud Again.\n\nWe Will Make America Prosperous Again.\n\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\n\nFriends and fellow citizens, We Will Make America Great Again!\u0000","30":"Thank you. Thank you all so much. It is great being here on the stage at UNH with my friend Bernie Sanders, one of the most passionate champions for equality and justice that I have ever seen and someone who I am looking forward to working with to get  the kind of agenda through our Congress that will begin to make our country stronger by providing the kind of support that working families and middle class families so richly deserve.\nBernie's campaign energized so many young people, some of you in this crowd. And there is no group of Americans who have more at stake in this election than young Americans because so much of what will happen will affect your lives, your jobs, the kind of country we are, the kind of future we want to build together.\n\nI'm proud of the primary campaign that Bernie and I ran. We ran a campaign about issues, not insults. And when it was over, we began to work together to try to figure out how we could take the issues we agreed on and come together knowing we are stronger together to come up with specific policies in education, in health and so much else. Thank you, Bernie. Thank you for your leadership, and thank you for your support in this campaign.\n\nNow, we're going to need some help in Washington. And I hope New Hampshire will send your now Governor Maggie Hassan to Washington as your senator. And I sure hope you will send Carol Shea Porter back to Washington.\n\nIsn't this one of the strangest elections you've ever seen? I - I really sometimes don't know what to make of it. Standing on that debate stage the other night, I was especially thinking about that. And, look, I have been very clear about what I want to do if I'm fortunate enough to be elected president. And Americans increasingly are zeroing in on the fact that we're not only electing a president, we're electing a commander-in-chief. We're looking to see who can protect our country and provide steady and strong leadership around the world.\n\nI was very honored today to earn the endorsement of John Warner, a retired Republican senator, World War II veteran, former - former secretary of the Navy who served under two Republican presidents. I served with him on the Senate Armed Services Committee. And I have the deepest respect for his patriotism. And it's a great honor. He's never endorsed a Democrat for president before. And I'm also very grateful that a number of Republicans and Independents here in New Hampshire have announced their support for this campaign. In fact, it is really an extraordinary honor that 150 Republicans here in New Hampshire are supporting this campaign because they understand how high the stakes are.\n\nThe next - the next 40 days will determine the next 40 years. So I'm going to close my campaign the way I started my public service and my career: fighting for kids and families. That's been the cause of my life. And it will be the mission of my presidency. And when you go to vote in November or if you vote early, it's not just my name on the ballot. Every issue you care about, think about it because, in effect, it's on the ballot, too. It's whether or not we continue to fight climate change or we give in to denial. This is a big deal. I never thought when I gave my acceptance speech to the Democratic National Convention that I would have to put in the following sentence, 'I believe in science.' Climate change is real. It's serious. And we have to be united and committed in addressing it. I never thought I'd hear someone running for president, my opponent, who says he wants to appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn marriage equality and turn the clock back on LGBT Americans, overturn a woman's right to make her own healthcare decisions and reverse that fundamental right and so much more.\n\nSo there's a lot at stake. And that's why some of the analysts are saying more Americans will vote in this election than ever before. We had more people watching that debate than any presidential debate before. And that's why we have to focus on what we want to do because I want to make a difference in your lives.\n\nAnd one of the biggest issues that I heard about throughout the campaign that I hear about from every corner of our country is how much an education costs. Bernie is absolutely right. I remember when I went to college, my dad, who was a small business man - he had saved up money, but I had to work. I had to work through college, work during the school year, work during summers, but that was okay. We were able to put it together. It wasn't so much that it endangered me or my family's financial future.\n\nAnd then I decided to go to law school, and my dad said, 'Well, I can't help you. That - we're done. We can't help you.' So I kept working. I got a small scholarship, but then I took out loans. And I paid those loans back. But I was lucky because I signed up for a program that gave me the opportunity to pay my loans back as a percentage of my in-come, not a fixed interest rate. That's why I could go to work for the Children's Defense Fund. I think I made $14,000 a year, as I recall. I could never have done that if I had had the kind of interest rates that so many young people now are facing.\n\nIt's absolutely wrong, and it has undermined the fundamental right to pursue your dreams, to have that education, to get those opportunities that you so rightly deserve.\n\nNow, New Hampshire has the highest proportion of students with debt in the country and the second-highest average debt per student. As a student I met here in New Hampshire said, going to college should be hard, but paying for college shouldn't be so hard that it prevents you from getting your education.\n\nIndeed, here in New Hampshire, we've got so many young people graduating with debt who aren't able to get started in their careers, aren't able to do the jobs like I could do, because they have to get a job that pays as much as possible to begin paying their debt down. So we should, and we will, make public colleges tuition-free for families earning less than $125,000 a year.\n\nAnd if you already have student debt, like so many students have here in New Hamp-shire, we will help you refinance it. It is absolutely outrageous that you cannot refinance student debt, and it is even worse that you're being charged interest rates that are so much higher than anything that anybody else is paying to buy a house, to buy a car, to borrow money for a business. I don't know how we got to where we are, but we are going to fix it. This is wrong. It's wrong for students, it's wrong for families, and it's wrong for our country.\n\nI also have met a lot of young people who want to start a business. They want to be entrepreneurs. It's the classic American story; start that business in the garage or the basement; get going. But they can't get credit because they have student debt. Nobody will help them out, no matter how good the idea is. So we're going to put a moratorium, so you don't have to pay your student debt back for a couple of years while you try to get your business started, and you get the chance to get the credit you need.\n\nWe are also - we are also going to provide loan forgiveness for people willing to go into public service or national service. And in Florida on Friday I'll give a speech about why that is so important.\n\nNow, when you add it up, our plan will help millions of people save thousands of dollars. Our campaign has built a tool to help you see how our college plan will actually help you, not in general, but really specifically you, the situation you're in. To check it out, go to hillaryclinton.com\/calculator.\n\nNow, we have an example right here, and this presentation is what you can see when you go to our website. You can say, 'I have student debt,' you can say, 'I am planning for college,' you can put in what your annual household income is, how much you will save, and we are trying to make it as specific as possible because I don't want anybody to miss out on what this plan can do for you. You can choose whether you have student debt.\n\nI met a young woman just yesterday in North Carolina who said, 'Nobody really ex-plained to me and my family what I was getting into.' I hear that so much. You know, these financial aid forms, one is called FAFSA, it takes forever to fill out, and at the end of it you really don't know what it means? Well, we're going to be really explicit. You know, we do have technology in America. And we ought to use it more to help people understand what they're getting into and to provide alternatives so that they don't make the wrong decisions for themselves.\n\nSo, please, use this, you know? You will save $60,640 if you're in one of these categories. But there is a way to understand the choices you have to make for everybody. So I hope you will go to hillaryclinton.com\/calculator.\n\nBut I have to say this: none of this will happen if you all don't turn out and vote. None of it. You know, I see all the signs saying, 'I will vote.' There is also a website. Please go to iwillvote.com to make sure you're registered. All the information is there. You put in your name, you put in your address, and through the miracle of technology you can find out if you're registered, or maybe because you moved you were purged from the records and you have to register again. New Hampshire makes it easy. You can have same-day registration.\n\nSo both Bernie and I are excited about what we can do together. I am really looking forward to working with him and other strong Democrats and Republicans who want to help solve problems again in America. Bringing people together is what I'm going to spend a lot of my time doing as your president. And if you've had a chance to see or meet my running mate, Tim Kaine, you know how hard he'll work to get things done and make it a high priority to produce results.\n\nSo we're going to move now to the panel, and I'm very pleased to have Mary Jo Brown moderating, along with Doug Martin, who you heard from earlier. I know they have collected up questions from the crowd. But I will end by saying that I'm excited about what we can do to make college affordable, and especially as Bernie rightly said, open the doors to families and young people who have been left out. We also want to make Pell grants once again available year-round, and we want to make sure that we have - specific help for certain groups of students.\n\nI'll end with this story. I taught at the University of Arkansas Law School some years ago, and I met a lot of students, not only in the law school but students on campus. I'd go and eat with them and go to events with them, and I met a lot of students who scraped together the tuition money, but then something happened. You know, maybe they were already parents and their childcare fell apart. Maybe they had to drive to and from school; they lived out in the country and their old car finally broke down and there was no public transportation. Or maybe they had a health emergency. And they would come and they would say to me, 'What can I do? Where can I get the $300 to fix the car? Where can I find childcare? How can I pay the doctor's bills?'\n\nAnd I realized that we've got to take care of tuition, making sure that you can go and be able to start and finish school. We've got to make sure costs and expenses, Pell grants and other ways of helping. But we also have to fill the gaps that exist for a lot of students. So I helped to start something called the Arkansas Single-Parent Scholarship Fund, because the people who had the most unexpected expenses were young parents, mostly, but not always, single moms, young, divorced, pretty much on their own, trying to improve their lives and prospects.\n\nAnd we started a fund to help fill those gaps, and, you know, we did it over so many years now, about 35 years, and we've helped thousands of people, so they didn't have to drop out. They didn't have to cut back. That's what I want for our country again, where we're helping each other, where we're reaching out and giving everybody a chance, and, yes, sometimes a second or third chance, to make the most of their lives, to pursue their dreams. I think the American dream is big enough for everybody, and education is absolutely essential to it.\n\nSo please make sure you come out and vote in this election. Thank you, all.\u0000","31":"Thank you. Wow! Thank you all. Woo!\nThank you. Thank you. I -- I got to -- I got to say, after hearing -- after hearing from these two extraordinary men I -- I feel all fired up and ready to go for the next five days.\n\nIt is so great to be back here with all of you, and there are a few people in the audience that I just want to acknowledge because I'm delighted they're there -- U.S. Congressman David Price I saw right there.Thank you, David.\n\nState Senator Dan Blue Jr., I know, right there. Thank you, Dan.And I'm not sure she's still here, but Deborah Ross, who I hope is your next senator. There she is!\n\nBecause everything Pharrell and Bernie just said is not only about the presidential election and what's at stake, it is about who's going to represent you as your governor, as your senator, as members of Congress and the legislature, and you have some excellent candidates. And we are so hopeful that you will vote for them and vote for what they represent.\n\nNow, I really want to thank my friend, Bernie Sanders, for everything that he has done.\n\nI -- I got to serve with Bernie. We were colleagues in the Senate. I saw firsthand his commitment to the people of Vermont and to the values that have guided his life. And when we faced each other in the primary, here's what I was so proud about. We ran a campaign on the issues that matter to the American people.\n\nAnd I -- I think because of that campaign, we were able to raise a lot of the issues that you heard Bernie talking about to the level that they are part of this presidential cam-paign, and they will be part of our agenda after January 20th, Bernie.\n\nAnd I've got to say, too, this election has been a lot more fun now that we're on the same side.\n\nAnd I want to thank Bernie for everything he's done. He's crisscrossing our country, energizing people, getting folks off the sidelines and engaged in politics. And there's no question that his efforts are paying off.\n\nAnd what he said at the beginning of his remarks is absolutely true. My name may be on the ballot, but it is not about me, it's not about my opponent, it's not about Bernie, it's not about David or Deborah, it is about you and your lives and what we're going to do together.\n\nNow, Bernie and I have already worked, we've worked on the plan that he told you about to make college tuition-free for the middle-class, for working families, for poor kids and debt-free for everyone.\n\nBecause as Bernie said earlier this year, when people who care about progressive causes stand together, we win, and then we can get to work on making those causes into realities for the lives of our people. So I am proud to be here with you and I am so excited about -- of the election, about everything that we're going to do together.\n\nAnd I'm especially pleased to have Pharrell here.\n\nNow, every time I see him, which is not often enough, we always have a good conversation like we did before this event. He always gets you to think. Not only is he a world-class talent, but he is a passionate advocate for issues that are too often overlooked and ignored. He wants to -- and I'm going to do everything I can help him -- to deliver -- giving kids who are at risk access to educational and arts programs that they deserve to have just as much as any other child.\n\nSo tell me this, tell me this, North Carolina, tell me, North Carolina, are you really, really, really happy that we're here tonight?\n\nWell, we sure are. There's nowhere we'd rather be.Now, let me ask you this, how many of you have already voted?Well, I hope you're going to bring more people to vote as well, right?Are you ready to volunteer?\n\nWe can all use you in these last days. Are you ready to elect Roy Cooper?\n\nWell, I'm glad to hear that because it's time you had a governor who puts families first, not radical ideology.And I love seeing our educators stand up and applaud because you need a governor who actually cares about the education of the children of North Carolina.\n\nNow, are you ready to elect Deborah Ross to the United States Senate? I'll tell you -- I'll tell you, Deborah and her race are the talk of everywhere. People know she will be an independent voice for North Carolina families, that she will represent you with integrity and excellence. And unlike her opponent, she's never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump.\n\nAre you ready now to choose our next president and commander-in- chief?\n\nWell, I'm -- I'm excited. Did any of you see the debates?Well, you know, there's several -- there's several notable aspects of those debates.\n\nI mean, one is the very fact that I stood on the stage for four and a half hours with my opponent proving, once and for all, I have the stamina to be president and commander-in-chief.\n\nBut you know -- but you know, he -- he also kept saying, like oh, well you know, what have you done for the last 30 years? And you know, occasionally I would interject and say what I had done.\n\nAnd today, in Greenville, we had a perfect comparison. I started my career fighting for children and families with the Children's Defense Fund when I got right out of law school in the 1970's.\n\nI went to South Carolina to gather evidence to stop the government in South Carolina for -- from putting young men, teenagers in jails with adults. I went to Alabama undercover to gather information about segregated academies to deprive them of tax-exempt status, which they did not deserve.\n\nI went door-to-door in New Bedford, Massachusetts, gathering information to make the case that every child in America, including children with disabilities, should have the right to a public school education.\n\nAnd as we heard this morning from a -- just a wonderful, distinguished older woman by the name of Mae Wiggins who came all the way down to tell her story. She was a nurse in New York City back in the 1970's, excited about being a young nurse, getting her career off to a start. And she was looking for a place to live, and she had a budget like everybody does. And she found what she thought would be the perfect place. It was within her budget. It was close to work.\n\nShe went to apply for an apartment. It was a new building -- brand new building. It wasn't even totally finished yet. She went into the little office and asked for an application and they said, \"Oh, we don't have any apartments.\" She said, \"But I saw the advertisement.\" \"Well, we have no apartments left.\"\n\nWell, she thought that was pretty peculiar and so she decided to do a little investigation and she found out that all of her African- American friends who had gone to that apartment run by Donald Trump and his father, Fred, had been told there were no apartments.\n\nSo she had the gumption to go and make a complaint, which led to the Justice Depart-ment suing them for discrimination. They settled the suit, but then they had to come back a year later and sue them again because they were still discriminating.\n\nSo when you hear, as Bernie so powerfully said at the end of his remarks, that we are standing against the possibility of returning and normalizing discrimination, take it seriously, my friends, because it truly is -- it truly is at stake in this election.\n\nAnd I was also very, very grateful. I had a role in helping to create the Children's Health Insurance Program as first lady, and let me tell you, one of the great -- one of the great honors as I travel across the country is meeting young people who are the beneficiaries or meeting their families.\n\nI met a woman here in North Carolina who told her story and we actually recorded it because all of us were so moved by what she had to say when her baby was born. Her daughter, she was deaf. And the doctors all said she'll never -- she'll never communicate, so she cannot learn to speak, so you need to teach her sign language.\n\nAnd the mom did all this research and concluded that there were some treatments that might help her daughter, but she didn't have that kind of money. They didn't have that kind of insurance. And she was telling her doctor she didn't know what to do, and the doctor just serendipitously said, \"You know, there's this new program, it's called the Children's Health Insurance Program. It's for people who are not poor, but they don't make enough money to afford that kind of insurance, and they don't work for an employer who provides it. You should look into it.\" And she did. And that began the process of her getting the treatment that her daughter needed.\n\nAnd when I met the mother, I also met the daughter, right here. I talked with her. She told me how proud she was because she had just graduated from college, George Washington University.\n\nSo, yes, you know, I do sweat the details and I do have a lot of plans. Tim Kaine and I put a whole book out called \"Stronger Together\" telling you exactly what we're going to try to do if we're fortunate enough to be president and vice president because I actually think it's important for you to know what we're going to do together.\n\nAnd as your -- as a senator, I helped to rebuild New York City after 9\/11 and provided health care to our brave first responders. As your secretary of state, I traveled to 112 countries, negotiated cease-fires, reduced the threat of nuclear weapons, stood up for human rights and women's rights and LGBT rights all around the world.\n\nAnd you know, everything I've done started by listening to people. Listening to hear your stories, what you're worried about, and then working to bring people together to find common ground, even with people who disagreed with me on lots of issues.\n\nYou know, when I was first lady, I had a great commitment to kids in foster care and I wanted to improve our foster care and adoption laws, and I was looking for some Re-publican to work with me, and I found one because I did my research and found out that one of the most partisan Republicans, Congressman Tom DeLay from Texas, had a heart for children in foster care. He and his wife had fostered children, and I called him up.\n\nI said, \"Congressman, would you work with me to change the laws on foster care and adoption?\" There was a silence. He said, \"Well, what do you want me to do?\" I said, \"Well, come to the White House. Come to a meeting. We'll sit down and figure out what we can do.\" And we did, and I meet those kids, and I meet those families, kids who were taken out of foster care and given the chance to have a loving permanent family for the first time.\n\nNow, I'm telling you this because I really believe that's the only way we're going to get things done. And if you elect me next Tuesday, that is the kind of president I will be.\n\nSo, let me just mention a few of the ideas that we've been putting forward to help you and your families get ahead and stay ahead because I truly believe you need a candidate you can vote for, not just someone to vote against.\n\nBut as you're making this choice, we need to be clear about what the choice is, because come January 20th, America will have a new president. It will either be me or my opponent.\n\nNow, I think it's fair to say, things are going to change. Change is part of life. That much is certain. The question is what kind of change are we going to see? Are we going to build a stronger, fairer, better America or are we going to fear each other and fear our future?\n\nI want you just to imagine, imagine the different kinds of futures that are available depending upon who's elected on January 20th, because by imagining it, I want you to think about every issue you care about, everything that is dear to you, everything that you heard from Pharrell and from Bernie.\n\nIt's hard for me to imagine that we would have a president who has demeaned women, mocked the disabled, insulted African-Americans and Latinos, pitted people against each other instead of bringing them together. That is, unfortunately though, what we have seen in this campaign, what we have seen, what's been said and how distressful it's been.\n\nI know there are a lot of people who are upset about what's going on in this campaign, aren't there? People come and talk to me. I've had people say that they can't sleep, that their stomachs are bothering them, they have headaches. And I think that's an im-portant signal because this is a big decision. And as Michelle Obama has said, the presidency doesn't change you -- who you are, it reveals who you are.\n\nAnd I think it's fair to say that my opponent has already revealed who he is. And he wants to ban every Muslim in the world from coming to the United States. Our country is founded on religious freedom. It is one of the most important building blocks of our democracy.\n\nHe has said that he thinks the lives of black people are all crime and poverty and des-pair. He has no idea -- no idea about the strength of the black church, the vibrancy of black-owned businesses, the excellence of historically black colleges and universities.\n\nHe seems not to recognize the rise of a new generation of black activists for social justice and the success of black leaders in every field.\n\nAnd we saw that again in the way he treated the Central Park Five. These were five black and Latino kids, some as young as 14, who were wrongly convicted of a terrible crime in New York City back in 1990. Donald Trump took out full-page ads in four newspapers calling for the death penalty for these kids. Nearly three decades later, they were exonerated by DNA evidence.\n\nAnd in addition, someone else confessed to the crime, so they were finally released from prison. But not only did Trump refuse to apologize for what he had said about them and even calling for their executions, he actually said, \"They should still be in prison.\" Evidence didn't matter. The law didn't matter. To him, those kids would always be guilty.\n\nSo think about it, if he wants to keep exonerated people in jail, how can we trust him to fight for the rule of justice and fairness and criminal justice reform in America?\n\nDo we want him appointing our judges?\n\n No!\n\n Do we want him controlling the Justice Department?\n\n No!\n\n Well, I've said many times, he has shown us who he is, now it is up to us to decide who we are. And right now, people across our country are coming together to do just that. They are rejecting the dark and divisive vision for one that is more hopeful and inclusive. We know that America is big-hearted, not small-minded. We want to lift people up, not tear each other down.\n\nAnd that's why I do believe we are stronger together, so let me paint you a different picture. Here's what we're going to do together. We're going to take on systemic racism with a full commitment and real follow-through because we refuse to accept as normal some of what we're seeing across America.\n\nWhat happened to that church in Mississippi yesterday should not have happened and it should never be accepted. People painted the words \"Vote Trump\" on the side and then set it on fire. Who would do that? Who would do that to a place of worship where people seek solace? That can never be normal. It can never be acceptable.\n\nWhat happened in Flint, Michigan, as Bernie said, can never be normal, can never be acceptable.\n\nLittle children drinking and bathing in poisoned water that will affect their health for years to come.\n\nAnd then we know, don't we? Too many young African-Americans are dying in police incidents or because of gun violence.\n\nWe know their names; Trayvon Martin and Eric Garner and Sandra Bland and Keith Scott and so many others. We have got to face this, and we're going to get to work to do just that. We are going to - we are going to dismantle the so-called school-to-prison pipeline and we're going to replace it with a cradle-to-college pipeline.\n\nAnd we're going to start with our youngest kids and their families to give them the support that they need. And we're going to take a hard look at what we need to do to make sure every child has the chance to attend good schools with good teachers, no matter what their ZIP code is.\n\nAnd we will reform our criminal justice system from end-to-end. It is wrong, my friends, that black men are far more likely to be stopped by police, charged and sentenced to longer prison terms than white men for the same offenses.\n\nWhen I -- when I launched this campaign back in April of 2015, the very first speech I gave was on the topic of criminal justice reform. I said then and I have repeated it throughout this campaign, we must end the era of mass incarceration.\n\nToo many families have been broken up, too many communities have been so badly affected. We have to reform these mandatory minimums and sentencing. We have to ban the box so people who have served their time can get a real chance at a good job and a fresh start.\n\nAnd we have to restore trust between police and communities. We are all safer when everyone has respect for the law and everyone is respected by the law.\n\nThis is important, of course, to families and communities, but it is important to all of us. This is about who we are as a country, about whether we really are a nation that believes in freedom and justice for all. Too often, despite the progress we've made, we fall short of that goal, and we have to be honest about it.\n\nI am determined to make this one of the most important projects of my presidency and I hope all of you will join me in doing that.\n\nAnd I have to say - I have to say that is only part of what must be done because the leading cause of death for young African-American men, more than the next nine causes.\n\nWe have 33,000 people a year dying from guns. I just cannot tolerate this any longer. I have met the families of those who have lost loved ones, who have lost the first graders in Sandy Hook, the bible study churchgoers in Charleston, the club-goers in Orlando, the moviegoers in Aurora, Colorado, people going about their lives being cut down and cut senselessly short. We have to take steps to reduce gun violence, and I know we can do that because the vast majority of Americans agree something must be done and a very big majority of gun owners agree as well.\n\nAnd we've got to make investments in those communities that are struggling, especially communities of color.\n\nWhen I was in eastern North Carolina today and I was talking to people there who had been devastated by Hurricane Matthew, people who didn't have very much to start with, who lost everything, farmers with 100, 200 acres growing sweet potatoes, wiped out. We've got to help everybody get ahead.\n\nI believe that the economy must work for everyone, not just those at the top. And I think hardworking Americans deserve a raise and women deserve equal pay.\n\nSo, how are we going to do this? Well, we're going to go where the money is. Just as Bernie said, we're going to make the wealthy pay their fair share, and make sure Wall Street never threatens Main Street again.\n\nAnd I can't wait to work with Bernie to make public colleges and universities like N.C. State right here at Raleigh tuition-free.\n\nI know that this is another issue Pharrell feels passionately about as well. If you're struggling with student debt, we're going to cut that and help you pay it back and get out from under it.\n\nAnd in my plan is a $25 billion fund specifically aimed at supporting historically black colleges and universities - schools like Shaw and Saint Augustine - because you know they produce some of the finest leaders in our country, and I want to make sure they keep doing that vital work.\n\nSo we could go on all night. I mean, Bernie and I could really keep you here until breakfast because we get excited about what we can do. But of course, we can't do anything if you don't get out and vote and get everybody you know to vote.\n\nThis is going to be one of the most consequential elections in our country's history, you know that, because we are at a crossroads. It's not just who my opponent is. Pharrell is right, we don't even have to mention his name very much. Right? It's not just about him, although there are some special features that certainly raise deep concerns. It's about who we are. It's about what we want, what we're going to do to make our mark on our country at this time in our history.\n\nI believe -- I believe America's best days are still ahead of us if we do what we're sup-posed to do.\n\nEvery social movement, every economic advance has only come about because people were willing to work and sacrifice and keep pushing forward in the face of adversity. It's not easy. It wasn't easy to get the vote for women. It wasn't easy to have the final efforts made to ensure that the Civil Rights Act was enforced. It wasn't easy because there are powerful interests still trying to push us back and push us down.\n\nAnd right now, you know, because in this state a lot of effort was put into trying to suppress the vote, right?\n\nAnd some people got discouraged about that. I've met some people who say, well, you know, I don't even know what they want, what kind of identification. It gets a little discouraging. You cannot get discouraged. Do not grow weary while doing good, right?\n\nIt is now our turn -- our turn to stand up to people like your governor and your legislature who wanted to shut you down and push you back because we are fundamentally a good nation and we need to make sure we deliver on that promise.\n\nAnd in this election, President Obama's entire legacy is on the line, everything that he has worked so hard to do against implacable opposition. As the president said yesterday, everything we've done is dependent upon him being able to pass the baton to somebody who believes in the same things he believes in.\n\nSo I got to tell you, I've told the president I'm ready to take the baton, but he's going to have to bend over because he's a lot taller than I am.\n\nBut I'm not just taking it, all of us are taking it. We are ready to grab that baton, to defend and build upon the progress of his presidency, and that is why everyone must vote. Early vote and vote on Tuesday if you can't get to early vote.And listen to this, more than two million right here in North Carolina have already voted.\n\nSo make no mistake about it, you can make the difference, not only in who you elect, but in the agenda that those people will then get to work on. I want you to hold me accountable. I want you to be my partners, but I can't do any of this.\n\nYou know, when I was with our wonderful first lady last week, she reminded --she reminded the big crowd we had in Winston-Salem that President Obama in 2008 won this state by about 14,000 votes.\n\nIf you break that down, you know what the difference between winning and losing is? Roughly two votes per precinct. So don't let anybody tell you their vote doesn't matter. You've got to get everyone you know to come out and vote. You can vote early through this Saturday, November 5th. If you don't know where to vote, go to iwillvote.com to confirm your voting location because the best way to repudiate the bigotry and the bluster and the bullying and the hateful rhetoric and discrimination is to show up with the biggest turnout in American history.\n\nAnd then that will be the story of this election. Let's make that one for the history books. Please be part of what we're doing in these next days and let's make sure that we not only have a future we can believe in, but one we can help create together, and demonstrate, once and for all, that love trumps hate.\n\nThank you all.\u0000","32":"Thank you so much! Wow, it is great to be back in Cincinnati. What a beautiful night on the banks of this magnificent river. I am grateful to all of you. I am thrilled to be here with my dear friends Mark and Gabby, and with all of you, because there are just eight days left in what is the most important election of our lifetimes.\nAre you ready to work hard in this election and win it? Are you ready to send Ted Strickland to the United States Senate? I've known Ted a long time. He is a champion for workers and families. He knows that Ohio needs more good jobs with rising wages. And he is the kind of person who will actually work to get things done, breaking through the gridlock in Washington. And this is important: unlike his opponent, Ted Strickland has never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump.\n\nI also want to thank Mayor John Cranley and State Representative Alicia Reece and all the other elected officials, including my friend, the Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, from across the river in Kentucky. And we are so fortunate to have two other champions for American families with us today. I am awed by the courage and commitment that both Mark and Gabby bring to their work, to do everything they can to help save lives in America.\n\nYou know, as Gabby says every day when she goes out, fight, fight, fight. And fight she does. She fights to make sure that we save lives and we prevent injuries and we do it together - to end the epidemic of gun violence that threatens our children, our fellow men and women, our country. And Gabby and Mark know something very important: there is a big majority of Americans, including a majority of gun owners, to stand behind and achieve commonsense gun safety measures. And I am looking forward to working with them as their partner.\n\nYou know, you go through life, you go through the campaigns, there are ups and there are downs. And my mother, who had a really difficult life, she told me something that has stayed with me and certainly has come in handy in this campaign. Everybody gets knocked down; what matters is whether you get back up. And throughout this campaign, I have stayed focused on one thing: you - your lives, your families, the problems that keep you up at night. Because that's really what this election is all about. It's not about the noise and the distractions. It's about what kind of country we want for our kids, and what kind of president can help get us there.\n\nI have so much that I want to do with you on behalf of Cincinnati and Ohio and America. And whether or not I get the chance to serve you really depends upon what happens in this election.\n\nNow, earlier today, I was up at Kent State, a great university, and I told them about some of the reasons why I think it's really important to get everybody out to vote in this election. But I started by saying that there's this new email story about - why in the world the FBI would decide to jump into an election without evidence of any wrongdoing with just days to go. That's a really good question. But I want you to know - look, I've said repeatedly I made a mistake, I'm not making any excuses, but I will tell you this. If they want to look at some more emails of one of my staffers, by all means, go ahead, look at them. And I know they will reach the same conclusion they reached when they looked at my emails last year, right? It wasn't even a close call, and I think most people have moved on. They're looking and focused on, okay, who is going to be the next president and commander-in-chief?\n\nDid any of you see the debates? Any of you see the debates? Well, I am - I got a little bit of a chance. I did stand there for four and a half hours with Donald Trump, proving conclusively I have the stamina to do the job. But I did occasionally get a chance to ask people to take a look at my 30 years of public service, my plans for our country, what Tim Kaine and I have said we want to do, and then weigh that against my opponent, what he's done and said. I am running against someone who says he doesn't understand why we can't use nuclear weapons. He actually said, \"Then why are we making them?\" He wants more countries to have nuclear weapons. He's mentioned Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia. Now, if you are hoping that he might surround himself with good people who would stop his crazy ideas, remember this. When he was asked who he consults with on foreign policy, Donald Trump said he didn't need to consult because, and I quote, \"I have a very good brain.\" He said he knows more about ISIS than our generals do.  No, Donald, you don't. And of course, the people that Donald Trump has around him include two men whose activities are also reportedly being investigated because of their ties to Russia, Vladimir Putin, and their allies.\n\nSo in these last days, let's not get distracted from the real choice in this election. Donald Trump has proven himself to be temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be president and commander-in-chief.\n\nI have to tell you, it does not give me any pleasure saying that. It's not a small thing. I have watched and known a lot of the people who have run for president, both Republicans and Democrats. And look, I've had my disagreements with Republicans. I might have disagreed on policies or principles, but I never doubted their fitness to serve in this office. Donald Trump is different, and that's why there is so much at stake in this election. He has a dark and divisive vision for America that could tear our country apart. Abraham Lincoln understood a house divided against itself cannot stand, and that was over the greatest of challenges - the challenge posed by slavery - and we fought a civil war. But we also have to take stock of how divided we are today, the kinds of divisions that need to be healed to bring people together.\n\nI will tell you this. I want to bring not just Democrats, but Republicans and Independents, people who vote for me and people who vote against me, together. Because I have a very different vision of America. Instead of dark and divisive, it's hopeful and inclusive. It's big-hearted, not small-minded. It is about lifting people up, not putting them down. It's a vision that says, and I believe this with all my heart, we are stronger together. And America is great because America is good. Never forget that. Yes, we have our flaws; of course, we're only humans. But what we have done over the course of our history to keep widening the circle of opportunity and equality and freedom is unlike any other place in the history of the world. So we want an America where women are respected - where our veterans are honored - where parents and families are supported and workers are paid fairly. And we believe in an America where marriage is a right, and discrimination is wrong. An America that leads in the world and lives up to our values, where everyone counts, everyone has a place, and the American dream is big enough for everybody. So the choice could not be clearer and the stakes could not be higher.\n\nWhen I was at Kent State talking about the threats that Donald Trump poses to our national security, I was really struck. It was a very big crowd, and it was primarily students. And I thought to myself, well, I'm not going to give a rah-rah speech because I really want to talk about what this means to national security. And I was introduced by a gentleman named Bruce Blair, a former Air Force officer in charge of the nuclear codes and keys. A launch officer. And he came out for me, along with now more than 30 launch officers, and basically they said, we cannot support Donald Trump because he should never, ever be near the nuclear codes and keys.\n\nAnd even the prospect of an actual nuclear war doesn't seem to bother him. \"Good luck. Enjoy yourselves, folks,\" is what he had to say about a potential nuclear conflict in Asia. I wonder if he even knows that a single - a single - nuclear warhead can kill millions of people? That is why dozens of retired nuclear launch officers took the unprecedented step of saying that Donald should, and I quote, \"not have his finger on the button.\" And when it comes to handling a crisis, we've seen in this campaign that Donald Trump loses his cool at the slightest provocation - when he's gotten a tough question from a reporter, or when he's challenged in a debate, or when he sees a protestor at a rally, when he's confronted by his own words. So imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis.  Imagine him plunging us into a war because somebody got under his very thin skin. I hope you'll think about that when you cast your vote in this election. Think about what it takes to lead in a very complicated world, and in whose hands you want to put the safety of our children and grandchildren.\n\nAnd think about the difference between electing a president who will do nothing and president who will tackle the epidemic of gun violence in America. As Gabby knows so well, 33,000 Americans a year are killed guns. Thousands more are injured. It's an average of 90 people a day dying. Here in Ohio more people are killed by guns than die in car crashes. We have seen moviegoers gunned down in theaters, little children killed in their classrooms, clubgoers massacred in Orlando, nine faithful people murdered at Bible study in Charleston, South Carolina. And we've seen far too many young African American men and women killed by gun violence, which is now the leading cause of death for young black men. And when we think about that, we think of Dontre Hamilton or Jordan Davis or Trayvon Martin and others. I've had the great honor of getting to know their mothers, who have turned their grief into action and their mourning into a movement.\n\nBut here's what I want to say. If anything else in our country were killing as many people, people of good faith, people who believe, like we do, in the Second Amendment, people who own guns, people who go hunting, people who are collectors, we would say, hey, wait a minute. This can't go on. We need comprehensive background checks to close the gun show loophole, close the online loophole. And we know here in Ohio a majority of gun owners support these common-sense steps to prevent gun violence because they know we can respect the Second Amendment and keep our kids and communities safe at the same time. And we need to keep guns out of the hands suspected terrorists. If you are too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun, period.\n\nAnd look. There is a very clear difference. Donald Trump won't stand up to the gun lobby. He's sold out to them. In fact, the gun lobby is spending more on ads to get Donald Trump elected than any other group, more than $7 million in Ohio alone. And in return, Donald Trump has promised to repeat President Obama's actions to strengthen criminal background checks. Donald says guns should be allowed in nightclubs that serve alcohol. He's even said, on his very first day in office, he would require every school in America to let people carry guns into our classrooms. How can anyone think our schools would be safer with more guns?\n\nSo I have stood up to the gun lobby for years, which is why they are running all of these ads against me. And I will stand up to them as president. I will work with Gabby and Mark and Americans for Responsible Solutions to pass common sense reforms because we've got to keep guns out of the wrong hands and help save lives.\n\nI will also get up every day in the White House working my heart out for you, whatever I can do to knock down barriers to empower people, to get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top. That's how I was raised. I was raised to believe that if you work hard - and I believe in hard work - you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead in America. And I will never ever quit on you. When I tell you I'm going to try to do something that will make a positive difference in your life, I don't care what the political or other barriers are. We're going to find a way over, under, around, or through until we get it done. I've been fighting for families and underdogs my entire life, and I'm not stopping now. Remember, when our opponents go low, we go high. We're not going to be distracted. We're not going to be knocked off course. We know how much this election matters. And everything all of you can do between now and the time that the polls close is going to really count.\n\nNow, the Donald Trump campaign strategy is pretty simple. They've announced it. Their strategy is: get women to stay home, get young people to stay home, and get people of color to stay home. It's all part of his scorched-earth campaign, but it actually adds up to more than half of our whole population when you stop to think about it. And it goes against everything we stand for. So if you're as upset as I am by the campaign that he has run, the things he has said, insulting not just women but immigrants, Latinos, African Americans, prisoners of war, Muslims, veterans, the military - I mean, the list goes on and on. It's almost impossible to understand how somebody could run for president who seems not to like America as much as he does.\n\nSo you know the best way to stop him: by showing up with the biggest turnout in history. We need more Americans to vote. And I think we have a chance to get more Americans from all walks of life to vote because we're already seeing record turnout. Twenty-three million people have already voted in this election. And more than one million of them are right here in Ohio. There is no doubt if we vote, we win. So, please, if you haven't voted early, please do so. And please get your friends and your family, everybody you know to vote. Take people to vote with you. Try to help those who might have a little problem getting there.\n\nMake sure that everybody you know understands early voting has begun. And you can go to iwillvote.com to find your nearest early voting location because, make no mistake, whatever issue you care about - I've only mentioned a few tonight, but whatever issue you care about is on the ballot. Now, it may be my name and my opponent's name, but where we stand on these issues, what we've done in the past, what we have said we want to do in the future, that is all on the ballot. The future of our economy is at stake, of our education system is at stake. Fighting climate change and clean, renewable-energy jobs are at stake. LGBT equality is at stake. Equal pay for women is at stake. Actually, in the end, the American dream itself is at stake. So I want you to think about how you will feel on November 9th.\n\nHappy. I think that's the right answer. But just suppose, just suppose you go to bed early. Suppose you go to bed early. Maybe you were too busy to vote or maybe you didn't make calls or knock on doors. I want you to imagine. So you get up early on the morning of the 9th. And you log on to the news to find out, hey, what's going on, or maybe you turn on the TV or the radio, and you hear.\n\nI want you to really understand what that means for you and for all of us because I prefer for us to be motivated by what we're for, not what we're against. But I also think it's prudent to imagine what could happen if we don't do our part. And when in the future somebody asks you, maybe your kids or your grandkids, 'What did you do when everything was on the line?' I want you to be able to say, 'I voted for a better, fairer, stronger America.'\n\nLet's go out and, in these next eight days, do everything we can to make it clear we're going after the kind of future that includes everybody. We're going to build this economy: new jobs, rising wages. We're going to make college affordable and help you pay down your student debt. We are going to do what will give you the best chance for your own lives and the lives of our kids and our grandkids. So if we build that future together, we will be able to say we were part of making sure that America's best days are still ahead of us. And we will prove, once and for all, that love trumps hate.\n\nThank you all.\u0000","33":"Thank you. It's so great to be in Wisconsin tonight.\nA recent Reuters poll had us tied in Wisconsin, and we were just in Iowa where we are up by 10 in the Reuters poll - and a new post-debate Google poll has leading Hillary Clinton by 2 points nationwide, and that's despite the fact that they were suppressing bad news about Hillary Clinton.\n\nOn November 8th, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House.\n\nIt's going to be a victory for YOU, the American people.\n\nWe are going to end the Clinton Corruption and restore dignity and honesty to government service.\n\nHillary Clinton is an insider who fights only for her donors and for herself.\n\nI am an outsider fighting for you.\n\nOne of the first things we are going to do is restore law and order to this country. Our good friend, Sheriff Clarke, is here with us tonight.\n\nNew FBI statistics shows that homicide rose 15% last year in America's large cities, and that it's the largest single-year increase in 45 years.\n\nMore than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since January.\n\nHomicides are up nearly 50% in Washington D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.\n\nAcross the entire nation, for cities of all sizes, small and large, the homicide rates rose by more than 10% last year.\n\nThis is a national crisis.\n\nYet, my opponent, Hillary Clinton, continues to attack the police. First, she calls our supporters - many of them cops, soldiers and firefighters - deplorable and irredeemable.\n\nThen, in our debate this week, she accusses the entire country, including all of law enforcement, of \"implicit bias,\" - essentially suggesting that everyone, including our police, are basically racist and prejudiced.\n\nMaybe Hillary Clinton should confine her comments to herself. After all, she is the one who described young African-American men as \"super-predators.\"\n\nHow can Hillary Clinton try to lead this country when she has such a low opinion of its citizens?\n\nHow can she lead a country when she thinks America is full of racists, deplorables and irredeemables?\n\nBy smearing tens of millions of hardworking, decent Americans she has rendered herself unfit to be President.\n\nShe has nothing but hostility in her heart for hardworking Americans, of all backgrounds, who just want to live in safety, security and peace.\n\nThe police officers she attacks are the same people - of all colors and nationalities - who race into danger every day to save the lives of complete strangers.\n\nThose fostering the dangerous anti-police atmosphere in this country share directly in the blame for the violence and chaos that threatens our most vulnerable citizens.\n\nMy agenda of reducing crime will benefit all Americans, but those who will benefit most are African-American and Hispanic-American citizens living in high crime communities. We are going to save thousands of lives.\n\nThe special interests, the arrogant media, and the political insiders, don't want me to talk about the crime that is happening in our country and in our inner cities. They don't want you to know about the hurt and pain that is happening to our fellow citizens. They just want me to just go along with the same failed policies that have caused so much needless suffering and so much preventable heartache.\n\nWell, I have news for the people trying to silence me and trying to silence all of us.\n\nI will never back down from fighting to save American lives.\n\nI will never back down from fighting to save America's inner cities.\n\nThe only people Hillary Clinton ever fights for are the special interests who write her checks. Follow The Money.\n\nHillary Clinton has been a disaster for so many communities, but especially for African-American communities. I don't think African-Americans are going to come out and vote for Clinton - they are too smart, and they know they are being used. They also know that she'll do nothing for them once the election is over - she never does, and that will never change.\n\nSame thing goes for Hispanic voters - they are tired of being used by people like Hillary Clinton, that have no intention of doing anything for them once the election is over.\n\n58% of African-American youth don't have jobs. There is another shooting in Chicago every 2 hours. 45% of African-American children under the age of six are living in poverty.\n\nThe inner cities have been left behind.\n\nCrime is through the roof, public education is a disaster, there are no jobs, it's dangerous to walk down the street with your child. To the African-American community, I say: what do you have to lose? Vote for Donald Trump, I will fix it.\n\nI will fight for you harder than anyone has ever fought for you before.\n\nEverything you need to know about Hillary Clinton can be understood with this simple phrase: Follow The Money.\n\nThe large corporations who support terrible trade deals that offshore jobs - they are donating to Hillary Clinton.\n\nFollow The Money.\n\nThe Wall Street investors who have rigged the regulations against the middle class - they are donating to Hillary Clinton.\n\nFollow The Money.\n\nThe wealthy donors who want to shut down American energy - they are donating to Hillary Clinton.\n\nFollow The Money.\n\nThe special interests who want open borders, for cheap labor, are donating to Hillary Clinton.\n\nFollow The Money.\n\nShe and her financial backers will say anything, do anything, lie about anything to keep their grip on power - to keep their control over this country.\n\nIn her campaign for President, Hillary Clinton has received $100 million dollars in contributions from Wall Street and the hedge funds.\n\nShe received $4.1 million in speaking fees from financial firms.\n\nShe and Bill received a total of $150 million in speaking fees from special interests since Bill left office. It's all part of the rigged system being run at your expense.\n\nThe same groups paying Bill and Hillary for their speeches were lobbying the federal government.\n\nTwenty-two groups paying Bill Clinton for speeches lobbied the State Department while Hillary was Secretary of State.\n\nAnd don't forget the Clinton contributors were appointed to advisory boards by Secretary Clinton - or all the favors and access granted to those who provided funds. She even gave up 20% of America's uranium supply to Russia.\n\nShe put the office of Secretary of State up for sale - and if she ever got the chance, she'd put the Oval Office up for sale too.\n\nShe deleted and bleached 33,000 emails after a Congressional subpoena. 13 phones missing, several destroyed with a hammer. Her staffers taking the fifth amendment, and her ringleaders getting immunity deals. Foreign enemies with easy access to hack her server. Lies to Congress, under oath, about turning over her work-related emails.\n\nThe American people have had it with years, decades, of the Clintons' scandals and corruption.\n\nThis will be the year the American people said: Enough is enough.\n\nHillary Clinton is a vessel for the special interests trying to strip this country of its wealth, its jobs, and its status as a sovereign nation. She is a globalist who has made a career taking jobs from our country and giving them to other countries.\n\nI am not running to be President of the World. I am running to be President of the United States of America.\n\nFrom now on, it's going to be America First.\n\nThese special interests control Hillary Clinton. She is their chosen representative. You can disregard everything she says and just remember this phrase: Follow The Money. She's there for only one reason, to protect her donors and collect their money.\n\nLook at her career. She's been there for 30 years, and has never done anything for you and your family. She's failed at everything. She failed in Iraq, in Libya, in Syria, in Iran, in Egypt. She failed on ISIS - in fact, she unleashed ISIS onto the world.\n\nShe failed upstate New York - promising 200,000 jobs, but instead the jobs left. All she did was name a post office and a highway.\n\nShe failed the inner cities.\n\nShe's failed women and children.\n\nThe only people Hillary Clinton has ever delivered for are her donors.\n\nOur campaign is taking on big business, big media and big donors - we're taking them on for YOU. So you can have the future you want.\n\nI'm not owned or controlled by anyone - my loyalty is to you, and no one else. I WILL FIGHT FOR YOU.\n\nMy economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs.\n\nWe will cut your taxes, reduce regulations, negotiate great trade deals, unleash American energy and we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare.\n\nWe are also going to end common core and offer school choice to every disadvantaged child - including every poor Hispanic and African-American child in America. We will put every American kid on the ladder of American success: a great education, and a great job.\n\nThe people getting rich off the rigged system are the people throwing their money at Hillary Clinton.\n\nFollow the Money.\n\nOur campaign is about breaking-up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We're trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives.\n\nThey're all part of the same rigged political establishment. They go to the same restaurants, they attend the same conferences, they have the same friends and connections. And they are all in for a big day of reckoning on November 8th.\n\nGovernment will start working for you again. Fixing things is what I do. Just look at my projects in New York, and around the world, where I revitalized neighborhoods and lifted up skylines.\n\nThat's what I want to do for our country - I want to go into every neighborhood and unlock their potential for all of our people.\n\nTogether, we can accomplish anything we want.\n\nBut that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th - and it means you need to start voting early. Early voting is already underway.\n\nYou have to knock on doors. You have to pick up that phone. You have to campaign on the streets. Spread the love that we have in this room to the people of our country. To beat the system, you have to lift your voice, pound the pavement, and get out the vote. Visit our website to find out how you can help.\n\nYou have six weeks until the election. You have six weeks to make every dream you ever dreamed for your country come true.\n\nYou have one last magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this nation.\n\nDon't let it slip away. Don't let this chance go. Stand up and be heard - for your family, for your city, for your country.\n\nThe arrogance of Washington, D.C. will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.\n\nThis November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is Back - Bigger and Better and Stronger than Ever Before.\n\nHere is just some of what will happen starting in January of 2017:\n\nI am going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; repeal and replace Obamacare; unleash American energy; end illegal immigration; keep Radical Islamic terrorists out of our country; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\n\nWe will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.\n\nAmerican cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.\n\nAmerican steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.\n\nAmerican hands will rebuild this nation - and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.\n\nWe will put new American steel into the spine of this country.\n\nI will fight for every neglected part of this nation - and I will fight to bring us all together as Americans.\n\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\n\nIt is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.\n\nOnce more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.\n\nWe Will Make America Wealthy Again.\n\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\n\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\n\nAnd We Will Make America Great Again.\n\nThank you, and God Bless!\u0000","34":"Hello, Pittsburgh! Woah! Hello back there!\nThank you, thank you. Wow! It's great to be here at this extraordinary time in our country's history at this great university to have a chance on a beautiful day to lift our sights, to think about what we are capable of doing together. The kind of future that we can create if we search for and find common ground. And it is thrilling to have traveled across our country to see the hopefulness, to talk about the positive changes that are occurring.\n\nTo really see America at its best, and tomorrow, each and every one of you gets to make a decision as to whether or not, first, you will vote. Because in Pennsylvania, it's all about Election Day. Other places around the country have been voting for weeks. And what you will vote for.\n\nI'm here to ask you to vote for yourselves, vote for your families, vote for your futures, vote on the issues that matter to you because they are on the ballot, not just my name and my opponent's name. I want to thank Tom Colicchio for coming out here. He's in the middle of opening another one of his great restaurants, but he said he's got these two small kids and he just had to come and be part of lifting up this election and creating the kind of commitment that will bring a record breaking number of Americans to vote. We are on the path to seeing more Americans coming out to vote than we have ever seen in our history.\n\nAnd I am hoping that you won't just come out to vote, obviously, I hope you vote for me, but I also hope you will send Katie McGinty to the United States Senate. We've got some great elected officials here, and I want to recognize Congressman Mike Doyle, County Executive Rich Fitzgerald, from Pittsburgh, Mayor Bill Peduto, from Braddock, PA, Mayor John Fetterman.\n\nBut mostly, I'm here to say thanks. Thanks for taking time out to think about what's -- what the stakes are. I love you all, too. Absolutely! So for those who are still making up your minds or thinking, 'Maybe, maybe it's not worth voting at all,' let me just say: the choice in this election could not be clearer. It really is between division or unity. Between strong and steady leadership or a loose cannon. Between an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top, and an economy that is set up and run for those at the top.\n\nNow, I have spent my public career fighting for kids and families, and standing up for our country, and if you give me the privilege of your vote tomorrow, that is what I will do every single day of my presidency. I will get up in the White House, and I will think about what I can do that day to knock down barriers, to create opportunities, so that you have the chance to fulfill your own dreams. You see, I believe America's best days are still ahead of us. Now, that doesn't mean we don't have to work for it because we do. That doesn't mean that we can just expect it to happens as kind of a birthright, but I really believe that. I would not have worked for 18 months, travelled across our country, thought as hard as I have about what we need to do and how to do it together, proudly stand up and defend the legacy of President Obama, which has given our country progress in the right direction if I did not believe with all my heart that we could do this.\n\nRight? We can do this! We don't have to accept a dark and divisive vision for America. Tomorrow, you can vote for a hopeful, inclusive, big-hearted America. And our core values are being tested in this election. And I know that people are frustrated, a lot of people feel left out and left behind. There's fear, even anger, in our country. But I've got to say: anger is not a plan, my friends. If we're going to harness our energy and try to overcome our problems, then we've got to start talking to each other again, and we have to get good ideas wherever they come from.\n\nLast night in Manchester, New Hampshire, I was with Khizr Khan, whose son was killed while serving in Iraq. You might remember him from the Democratic Convention. He was not a man to be on the stage of a political convention, but when he heard my opponent say what he said about Muslims and he looked at the flag that had been draped on his son's coffin, he felt compelled to speak out. He spoke powerfully about what America means to him and how we have to defend our values and our Constitution.\n\nAs he said last night, his son serving in the United States Army with his unit saw something suspicious, moved toward it to check it out telling his men to stay behind, and when the car exploded, he lost his life. He was awarded Bronze Star and the Purple Heart, but as Mr. Khan said, \"When you listen to all the people that my opponent has insulted and denigrated, would there be a place in Donald Trump's America for Captain Khan?\" The Khan family gives me hope because they truly believe in the values of this great country of ours, and they have stood up holding the Constitution as he did at the convention to say, \"People around the world cherish this Constitution, believe in our values. It's a source of hope for billions of people. We will never, ever let that go, and we never let someone rip it away in the kind of negative, divisive, hateful campaign that we have seen from the other side in this election.\"\n\nSometimes when I hear my opponent speak, I don't recognize the country he's talking about. That doesn't mean we don't have problems and challenges, it doesn't mean that we don't have to do more to help people across our country get better economic opportunities. Of course, we do. But boy, I believe we can do it. I love our country. I believe in the American people. I know what we are capable of. Throughout of history, generations of Americans have risen together to meet the tests of their time. They defended democracy, built the greatest middle class that the world has ever seen, marched for civil rights and voting rights, for workers rights and women's rights, LGBT rights, and rights for people with disabilities.\n\nTomorrow, we face the test of our time, will we be coming together as a nation or getting further apart? Will we set goals that all of us can help meet? Or will we turn on each other and pit one group of Americans against another?\n\nNow, our names will be on the ballot tomorrow, but those values and every issue you care about will be there, too. What kind of country do we want, and I particularly think about this for young people as I look at this crowd and see so many students and young Americans that deserve the same opportunities that many of us were given. We will make sure they are available because if you think about what it takes to have a thriving America, it comes down to a couple of key issues.\n\nIf you believe that America thrives when the middle class thrives, then you have to vote. We're going to make the biggest investment in good-paying jobs since World War II, jobs in infrastructure, small business, clean energy, advanced manufacturing. We're going to actually deliver on that unlike my opponent, who makes his products mostly overseas, buys cheap Chinese steel and aluminum instead of what's made by American steelworkers right here in Pennsylvania. We're going to invest in America, and we're especially going to invest in communities that are left out and left behind. We're going to stand up for the right of workers to organize and bargain. We're going to get incomes rising across America.\n\nAnd if you believe we need a fairer economy as I do, then we're going to raise the national minimum wage, because no one who works full time in America should still be in poverty. And we're going to do more to support working families with affordable child care, paid leave, and finally, equal pay for women's work.\n\nI've got to tell you, this always get's about the biggest applause ever because fundamentally, we know it's not fair, but it's also about families. If you have a mother, a wife, a sister or a daughter who's working, you don't want her shortchanged, do you? Now, when I talk about equal pay and all of these other family issues, my opponent says I'm playing the woman's card. Well, you know what I say: deal me in.\n\nIf you believe all our kids should have good schools and good teachers, no matter what zip code they live in, then you have to vote. If you believe we can make college affordable for every young American, then you have got to vote.\n\nI've got to say, I was very proud of the primary campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran. It was a campaign on issues and ideas, not insults. And after it was over, he and I got together, and we came up with this plan. Public colleges and universities should be tuition-free for everyone who makes less than $125,000 a year. And it should be debt free for everybody else. I don't think you should go into this massive debt to get your education. It's good for you, it's good for your families, it's good for our country, and we're going to make it affordable for everyone. And for the millions of Americans already struggling with student debt, we're going to ease that burden. We're going to get those interest rates down, we're going to give you a different way of repaying it as a percentage of your income, not tied to a six, eight, 10 percent interest rate, and you're never going to have to pay more than you can afford.\n\nYou see, I think there are a lot of positive things to get excited about. And I think the agenda we've put forth in this campaign is one that will really give everybody hope. You see, working for children and families has been the cause of my life, but it's never been more important than it is right now.\n\nSo this has to be our mission together - doing all we can to help every American, especially every young American and especially every child, to have the chance to live up to your God-given potential. Because when it's all said and done, that's what matters the most. Have you helped somebody else? Have you reached out and tried to ease somebody's burden? We do it individually.\n\nMy mother got through a neglected, abandoned childhood because people showed her kindness. Her own parents didn't want her. Her own grandparents didn't want her. But that first grade teacher who saw she had nothing to eat, brought extra food every single day to make sure my mother had something to eat. And when she was 14 and had to go out and find a job to support herself and got a job as a maid and a babysitter in somebody's home, she was just relieved that she had somewhere to live and that she could support herself. But the mother of that home understood my mother wanted to go to high school and so she said, 'Dorothy, if you get up early and get your chores done, you can go to high school. You'll have to come right back because I'll need you, but you can do it.'\n\nAnd look, that sounds harsh to our ears, telling a 14 year old, 'Okay, you can go to high school but you have to come right back and you have to work on both sides of it.' But to my mother, it was a blessing. So when I think about what so many people have gone through to give us the opportunities that we had had, and I'm speaking for myself, my mother gave me the resilience, the grit, the get up and go. She told me, 'Everyone gets knocked down. What matters is if you get back up.' And we had a lot of Americans knocked down because of the Great Recession, didn't we? Millions of jobs were lost, millions of homes were lost. Family wealth was wiped out, savings account, 401K's, everything that people had worked so hard for.\n\nWell we've dug ourselves out of the hole and now we need to get up, and we've got to make sure we don't leave anybody behind. I see this man here standing with a sign: 'Coal Miners for Hillary,' and I'll tell you sir, I know how hard times are. And as I have said, and you can take it to the bank, I will not forget you and I will do everything I can to help people who have given so much, worked so hard throughout their lives for generations to build this country. We are not going to forget any American! But I can't do any of this without your help tomorrow.\n\nThis election is going to really set the course of our country. There's no doubt in my mind. Tonight, I'll be in Philadelphia with President Obama and Michelle and I so appreciate how hard they worked for me, but it's not for me. It's for us.\n\nWhen President Obama came into office, put yourself in his shoes -- this young, dynamic, first African-American elected to become President of the United States. And what does he find? He finds the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, that's what he finds.\n\nWow, those were hard, hard times. I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for making sure we didn't go even deeper in the ditch we were in. But make no mistake: there were reasons we ended up in that ditch. It didn't happen by accident. We had huge tax cuts on the wealthy, the administration in office took their eyes off the financial markets and we know what happened. They ignored the pressures in the mortgage markets and we know what happened.\n\nElections have consequences for everything we care about. And that's why we've got to each and every one of you put down your stake in our future. If the lines are long tomorrow, please wait. In early voting, we have had people waiting in line for two and three hours and there have been reporters and others going up and down the line, asking them, all types of Americans, not one type -- all types, 'Why are you here?' 'Because my future depends on it,' they say.\n\nSo tomorrow is the election, but that is just beginning. We have to heal this country. We have to bring people together, listen and respect each other. Now I know it's unusual for somebody running for president to say this, I started saying this months ago, because I was literally meeting who were scared about what they were hearing in this election. I've known a lot of the Republicans who've run for president been elected president in recent history, I didn't agree with them on everything, obviously we had our differences, but I didn't doubt that they were fit to serve as president. This election is different. This person is temperamentally unqualified, experientially unqualified to be president and so many people know that.\n\nSo I think we do need more love and kindness, right? We have to got to rise above all of this hate filled rhetoric, all of these insults and scapegoating and finger pointing and insulting. I want to be a president for all Americans. Not just some. I want to be the president for Democrats, Republicans and Independents. I want to be the president for those who vote for and those who vote against me. I want to represent everybody. Because I know we have a role to play in building a better future.\n\nSo it starts tomorrow. If you don't know where to vote, go to IWillVote.com. You can get all the information you need, the polls will be open from 7 AM to 8 PM. We are on track, as I said, to have a huge turnout. But we can only do that if all of you make up your minds, you bring all your friends, everybody you know, to make sure your voices are heard.\n\nThis is a historic, historic election and we're going to do everything we can, not only to win, but then immediately to get to work. And I especially invite anyone who wants to volunteer for the next 24 hours, go to hillaryclinton.com, text join, J-O-I-N to 4-7-2-4-6, stop by one of our offices. We would love to see you. Because when your kids and grandkids ask what you in the future what you did in 2016, when everything was on the line, you'll be able to say: you voted for a stronger, fairer, better America where we build bridges, not walls. And where we finally prove once and for all that, yes, love trumps hate. Thank you.\u0000","35":"Thank you.\nI am so happy to be back here in Columbus. Make sure you request your absentee ballot to vote by mail. And remind your friends and family to do the same.\n\nWe are now 26 days away from the most important election of our lifetimes.\n\nAnd we've only begun to fight.\n\nIf we win, we will create a booming and thriving economy for young Americans. We will create safe communities, lower taxes, leaner government, affordable childcare and healthcare, and a government that is honest and decent and fair.\n\nWe are the campaign of change.\n\nWe will deliver jobs, opportunity and justice for future generations.\n\nI've wanted this race to be about the issues. But the Clinton Campaign has refused to discuss the issues. They only place they want to go is the gutter.\n\nSo they have slandered and libeled me with false accusations - but we will not let these lies distract us from our campaign.\n\nIn an earlier speech today, I addressed the fact that I was falsely accused. It is disgraceful that you can have front page articles in the New York Times inventing false claims, without any evidence, any witnesses, anything at all.\n\nI want to talk about the policies affecting our lives, and your future.\n\nRight now, our government has been taken hostage by global special interests that will stop at nothing to drain every last ounce of wealth from this country for their personal benefit.\n\nThe greatest weapon wielded by the Clinton Machine is the media. The WikiLeaks emails show that the Clinton Machine and the Corporate Media are one in the same - they collaborate and conspire together.\n\nThis Washington establishment will stop at nothing to stop all of us.\n\nThese are the people who have given us decades of endless wars producing only death and bloodshed, but no victory.\n\nThese are the same people who have flung our doors open to Radical Islam, putting us on the same path to France of multigenerational struggles with violence and extremism embedded in our communities.\n\nThese are the people who've allowed violent international cartels to invade our country and prey on our most vulnerable citizens. Victims like Marilyn Pharis, raped by an illegal immigrant with a lengthy criminal record and beaten to death with a hammer.\n\nThese are the people who've let drugs pour into our country and poising our children.\n\nThese are the people who emptied the jobs out of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and North Carolina and shipped them to other countries.\n\nThe political powers trying to stop us are the people who've stripped the jobs form our inner cities, trapped millions of African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans in impoverished, crime-besieged neighborhoods, and left 70 million American women and child in poverty or near the brink of poverty.\n\nAt the center of this assault on American prosperity is the Clinton Machine. They don't work for you, they don't work for America, the work only for themselves and their donors - including foreign government and foreign actors.\n\nHillary Clinton is a criminal who destroyed 33,000 emails after a Congressional Subpoena.\n\nShe ignored hundreds of requests for security in Benghazi, causing the deaths of four brave Americans - and then she lied to the faces of the grieving parents about the reason for the attack.\n\nShe defended a man who violently and viciously raped a 12 year-old girl by horribly smearing and blaming the victim - and the she laughed about getting the rapist off the hook.\n\nSpeaking in secret to a foreign bank, Hillary pledged her support for \"open borders.\" That means tens of millions of new foreign workers to compete against you for your jobs, your wages, your futures - she's selling out the future of young American, of all backgrounds, to enrich her donors.\n\nWe won't let it happen.\n\nHillary and her special interest allies want to keep children in our inner cities trapped in failing schools.\n\nUnder a Trump Administration, disadvantaged children will be able to attend the public, private, charter or magnet school of their choice.\n\nUnder President Obama and Hillary Clinton, the national debt has almost doubled.\n\n$20 trillion-dollar national debt is a weight around the future of every young person in this country. It would require $120,000 from every millennial in the country to pay off.\n\nThe new debt added under Obama and Clinton would have been enough to pay off all the outstanding student loans in the United States 6 times over.\n\nYet, not one penny of that new debt has gone to lowering your tuition.\n\nThe share of 16-to-28-year-olds not in the labor force has increased to 45 percent during the Obama administration.\n\nIn a Trump Administration, we will work every day to make America great again for millennials.\n\nFirst, we will Lower the Cost of College and Solve the Student Loan Crisis.\n\nTuition at public four-year institutions was 40% higher in the last school year than it was ten years ago.\n\nIn all, Americans owe $1.3 trillion on their student loans--more than auto loans, credit card debt, or home equity loans nationwide.\n\nStudents should not be asked to pay more on their loans than they can afford, and the debt should not be an albatross around their necks for the rest of their lives.\n\nThat is why under my student loan program, we would cap repayment to an affordable portion of a borrower's income--12.5%. And if borrowers work hard and make their full payments for 15 years, we will let them get on with their lives.\n\nThat's the nature of the deal we give many public employees today.\n\nEvery American deserves the same deal, so we will equalize treatment so everyone can start saving for their families and retirement by the time they are 15 years out of college.\n\nIn addition, I will take steps to push colleges to cut the skyrocketing cost of tuition. If the federal government is going to subsidize student loans, it has a right to expect that colleges work hard to control costs and invest their resources in their students.\n\nIf colleges refuse to take this responsibility seriously, they will be held accountable--including by reconsidering whether those with huge endowments deserve to keep those endowments tax-exempt.\n\nSome schools are paying more to hedge funds and private equity managers than they are spending on tuition assistance--while taxpayers are guaranteeing hundreds of billions of dollars of student loans to pay for rising tuition.\n\nWe want universities to spend their endowments on their students, not themselves. They need to use that money to cut the college debt and college tuition.\n\nMuch of the skyrocketing cost of college education is due to the tremendous bloat in college administrators and bureaucrats. According to the Department of Education, the number of college administrators is up more than 60 percent since 1993--ten times the increase in tenured faculty positions.\n\nFederal regulations are responsible for much of this administrative bloat. Vanderbilt University estimated that it spends $150 million per year---11 percent of the university's budget--to comply with government regulations.\n\nAs president, I will immediately take steps to drive down college costs by reducing the unnecessary costs of compliance with federal regulations so that colleges can pass on the savings to students in the form of lower tuition.\n\nI will also make it a priority to protect students' rights to free speech on campus. In the past few decades, political correctness has transformed our institutions of higher education from ones that fostered spirited debate, to a place of extreme censorship where students are silenced.\n\nWe will end the political correctness, and foster free and respectful dialogue.\n\nWe also have to recognize that traditional four-year degree programs are not the only path to a good job and a good career. We should support schools that allow people to learn skills and practice a trade so young people can have access to the education that's right for them. And we must hold all schools equally accountable for their performance.\n\nI will make sure that students have the information they need about all of their options before starting school, and for repaying their student loans upon leaving school.\n\nThere is a lot of room for improvement in this regard. Currently, students navigate 16 complex repayment plans, 8 forgiveness programs, and 32 deferment and forbearance options--each of these programs has their own nuances and qualifications. I will simplify this confusing maze into a single Income-Based Repayment Program, similar to those that have proved so popular in recent years.\n\nWe also have to make sure that those who have graduated college and those who are soon to graduate can find a good job to start a good career when they do.\n\nMany mothers across this country are worried their kids won't find jobs, and they are right to be worried. One of the biggest threats is outsourcing - jobs for college-educated kids are being sent to other countries. At the same time, companies are importing low-wage workers on H-1B visas to take jobs from young college-trained Americans.\n\nWe will protect these jobs for Americans.\n\nMy economic plan - including tax, trade regulatory, and energy reforms - will create 25 million new jobs and allow the private sector to grow at 4 percent per year.\n\nThis includes reforms to protect and expand the sharing economy--startups like Uber--that have managed to provide great services to consumers, and create lots of jobs in the process.\n\nFinally, and most importantly, the foundation for a new prosperity will be a rededication to the constitutional rule of law.\n\nA vote for me is a vote for change, and a vote for me is really a vote for you.\n\nTogether, we are going to make America great again.\u0000","36":"Thank you.\nIt's great to be back here in beautiful Naples.\n\nIn 16 days, we are going to win the great state of Florida and we are going to win the White House.\n\nEarly voting begins tomorrow, and you can already get your absentee ballot, so make sure to start voting.\n\nYesterday, I outlined my Contract with the American Voter - a detailed list of solutions to bring prosperity to our economy, safety to our communities, and honesty to our government.\n\nOne of the issues I addressed at length is the issue of government corruption. I put forward a plan to stop it; my opponent has no plan to end government corruption because she is the embodiment of government corruption. Even as she was preparing to run for President, WikiLeaks emails show, Hillary was trying to get $12 million from the King of Morocco in yet one more Pay-For-Play scheme.\n\nMy goal is to keep foreign money out of American politics. Hillary Clinton's goal is to put the Oval Office up for sale to whatever country offers the highest price.\n\nSo I have a message today to the voters of America. It's a message for Republicans, Democrats and Independents. It's a message for those living in rural America, urban America and suburban America - because we are all just One America.\n\nIt's a message for everyone who wants to take back our government from the special interests.\n\nAnd my message is this: if we win on November 8th, we are going to fix our rigged system and we are going to Drain The Swamp Of Corruption In Washington, D.C.\n\nThat change includes a new foreign policy that puts America First.\n\nHillary Clinton's foreign policy has squandered trillions in American wealth overseas. Yet, for all the money spent, all Clinton delivered was death, destruction and terrorism. She unleashed ISIS and turmoil in Iraq, Syria and Libya.\n\nNext, trigger-happy Hillary wants to start a shooting war in Syria that could involve nuclear-armed Russia - she has bad judgment, bad instincts, and is just too reckless to be allowed into the Oval Office.\n\nHillary also started the negotiations that led to the Iran deal - and thus ultimately leading to the $1.7 billion ransom for American hostages.\n\nClinton gave Iran everything they wanted and more - including Iraq. Now, Iran is emboldened as never before.\n\nIn the latest insult to America, the government of Iran is demanding \"many billions,\" in new ransom payments for an American businessman and his ailing father. Adding to the insult, Iran has released a video of their captive that includes footage from earlier this year of American soldiers being forced to their knees at gunpoint.\n\nThe humiliation for our country never seems to end - and it's the humiliation brought on by a Secretary of State who was more interested in getting paid by foreign countries, than in representing the country she lives in.\n\nTo cover-up her crimes as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton bleached and deleted 33,000 emails, lied to Congress under oath, made 13 phones disappear - some with a hammer - and then told the FBI she couldn't remember 39 times.\n\nThe best evidence that the system is rigged is that Hillary Clinton is even allowed to run for President in the first place.\n\nThe Clintons grew their gross income by $60 million while Hillary was Secretary of State. She's not a diplomat - she's a grifter, always looking for an easy way to sell government favors and access in exchange for cash.\n\nThe Clintons end up with the money, and America ends up with the humiliation.\n\nWhen I am President, America will be respected in the world once again.\n\nThat also means standing up against the oppression of the Castro regime in Cuba, and standing in solidarity with freedom-loving people in Venezuela and across Latin America living under oppression. The Obama-Clinton Administration has abandoned our friends in Latin America, and delivered only poverty and joblessness for Hispanic-Americans here at home.\n\nIf you elect me, along with a Republican House and Senate, we will also immediately repeal the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military. It's part of my 100-day plan.\n\nThis will be a national effort that will involve everywhere from Key West to Tampa to the Space Coast to Jacksonville to the Panhandle.\n\nMy proposal is based on three crucial words: Peace Through Strength.\n\nThis defense build-up will be supported by ships in Mayport, and by engineers and advanced manufacturing on the Space Coast. New aircraft will fly from MacDill Air Force Base and Naval Air Station Pensacola.\n\nNew Navy and Coast Guard ships will patrol the Florida coast to prevent drugs and terrorists from entering our shores.\n\nWith a Republican House and Senate, we will also immediately repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare. Even Bill Clinton admitted Obamacare is \"the craziest thing in the world,\" where \"people wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half.\"\n\nReplacing Obamacare is part of my 100-day contract with the American Voter.\n\nA Republican House and Senate can swiftly enact the other items in my contract immediately, including massive tax reduction and tax simplification for the middle class. My plan to transform our tax, regulatory, energy and trade policies is the most pro-growth plan in American history. It includes lowering our business tax from 35 to 15 percent. My reform plan will lift millions out of poverty, raise wages dramatically, and create at least 25 million new jobs in 10 years - and we can enact the whole plan in our first 100 days.\n\nA Trump Administration will also work alongside you to restore and protect the beautiful Florida Everglades. Our plan will also help you upgrade water and wastewater systems so that the Florida Aquifer is pure and safe from pollution.\n\nWe will also repair the Herbert Hoover Dike in Lake Okeechobee.\n\nMy contract includes something else at the very center of this campaign: fixing our trade deals and ending the offshoring of American jobs.\n\nOne more way our system is rigged against the American Worker is that companies, like Carrier, simply fire their workers and move their operations to Mexico and other countries.\n\nWhen I'm President, if companies want to fire their workers and leave for other countries, then we will charge them a 35% tax when they want to ship their products back into the United States.\n\nWe have a nearly $800 billion-dollar annual trade deficit in goods with the world. 1 in 5 American households don't have a single person in that household with a job.\n\nFlorida has lost 1 in 4 of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton.\n\nWe've lost 70,000 factories since China's entry into the World Trade Organization - another Bill and Hillary-backed deal.\n\nWe are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.\n\nA Trump Administration will stop the jobs from leaving our country.\n\nWe will start making things in America.\n\nWe will be a rich nation once again.\n\nBut to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country.\n\nImmigration security is national security.\n\nHillary's pledge for \"open borders\" includes an open border with the Middle East - meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within your communities and near your families.\n\nA new WikiLeaks email shows John Podesta secretly worried about the fact that Hillary Clinton never put procedures in place to keep the San Bernardino shooter out of America - including a plan to review social media postings. We're letting in Radical Islamic Terrorists right through the front door, and stamping their visas \"approved\" on the way in.\n\nSo let me state this as clearly as I can.\n\nIf I'm elected President I am going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country.\n\nWe will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration.\n\nA Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders. And yes, we will build a wall.\n\nWe have the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers.\n\nAll across our nation, innocent Americans have been killed by illegal immigrant criminals who should never have been in our country.\n\nKate Steinle was gunned down in her father's arms in broad daylight on a San Francisco pier. Her killer had been deported 5 times before.\n\n90 year-old Earl Olander was brutally beaten to death in his home by illegal immigrants with criminal records and left on the floor of his home to die.\n\nLaura Wilkerson's teenage son, Josh, was tortured and beaten to do by an illegal immigrant he offered to give a ride home. His body was viciously burned.\n\nThe examples go on and on and on.\n\nUnder a Trump Administration, this crime wave will come crashing to an end.\n\nThat includes the proposal, in my contract, for tough mandatory minimum prison sentences for illegal immigrants who re-enter the country after a previous deportation.\n\nWith a victory in November, everything will change.\n\nHere are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:\n\nthe biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation; defend religious liberty; provide school choice to every disadvantaged child in America, and we are going to end Common Core; support the men and women of law enforcement; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\n\nYou have 16 days to make this all happen - but you have to get out and vote, and that includes helping me elect a Republican Congress to enact my 100-day America-First action plan.\n\nOur failed establishment will be replaced with a new government guided by the principles I outlined in my contract with the American Voter.\n\nIt will be a government of, by and for the people.\n\nFor those who feel like they don't have a voice, I have a simple reply: I Am Your Voice.\n\nI'm going to fight for every American in every last part of this nation.\n\nI'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people - not the donors and special interests.\n\nAnd I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.\n\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\n\nYou're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life.\n\nThis is a movement like the world has never seen before.\n\nYou're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most\n\nimportant vote you've ever cast for anyone at any time.\n\nWe Will Make America Wealthy Again.\n\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\n\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\n\nAnd We Will Make America Great Again.\u0000","37":"Thanks, Maria, for that introduction, and for the work you and your organization do to honor these stolen American lives - and to advocate for justice on behalf of all American victims.\nI am honored to be here today and to shine a national spotlight on a group of victims who have been forced into the shadows. Your stories are not featured in the news, you have no demonstrators taking to the streets on your behalf, you have no special interests taking up your cause, and politicians ignore your cries for help. But I never will.\n\nI have met many incredible people during the course of this campaign. But nothing has moved me more deeply than the time I've spent with the families of the Remembrance Project, and the incredible strength and courage you've shown in your often lonely fight for justice.\n\nYou are heroes. And your actions will help us to save the next thousand American citizens from losing their brothers, sisters, sons, daughters or parents.\n\nThe most fundamental duty of government is to protect American lives. Anyone who fails to understand this is not fit to hold public office.\n\nEvery day our border remains open, innocent Americans are needlessly victimized. Every day Sanctuary Cities are left in place, innocent Americans are put in harm's way. Every day we fail to enforce our laws is a day when a loving parent is at risk of losing their child.\n\nIt's happening every single day.\n\nAll across this country, dining room tables have an empty seat at the family dinner table, because our government abandoned its duty and failed to enforce the laws.\n\nThere are a lot of numbers in the immigration debate. But let me give you the most important number of all. That most important number of all is the number of American lives it is acceptable to lose in the name of illegal immigration. Let me tell you what that number is: ZERO.\n\nOur nation should not accept one lost American life because our country failed to enforce its laws. What do you tell to the mother, who just buried her daughter, because someone was released at the border who should have been sent home?\n\nWhat do you tell to the young boy, who will grow up without a dad, because a criminal was deported five times but was allowed to keep coming back into the country?\n\nWhat do you tell the wife, who has lost her husband, because a Sanctuary City released an illegal immigrant from behind bars?\n\nThis must end. And it must end right now. Not one more American life should be given up in the name of open borders.\n\nJust look at what's happened in the last few days.\n\nLast week it was reported that authorities detained an illegal immigrant in the Austin area who is responsible for nearly a dozen sexual assaults and had been previously deported five times within a three-year period.\n\nEarlier this week, in Kansas, a Sheriff's Department Master Deputy was killed, apparently by an illegal immigrant. The driver was previously arrested for a DUI in California in 2001 and for a traffic violation in Kansas in 2013. Deputy Collins was killed only hours after his daughter's fourth birthday.\n\nA few days ago, two correctional officers in California were critically wounded after being shot by an illegal immigrant who overstayed his visa. This individual had been convicted for child rape and was slated to be deported - but his home country refused to take him back, so he was simply released. One of the victims has six children, is an Air Force Veteran, and a high school football coach - the other victim is a mother and a grandmother.\n\nWhen Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State, the matter of this country refusing to take back their deported citizens came before Hillary Clinton's desk. But she failed to take forceful action, and ignored the federal law requiring her to suspend visas to countries that don't take back their citizens.\n\nAccording to a report from the Boston Globe, from the year 2008 through 2014, nearly 13,000 criminal aliens were released back into U.S. communities because their home countries would not take them back. Most of these 13,000 releases occurred on Hillary Clinton's watch - she had the power and the duty to stop it cold and she didn't do it.\n\nNow, my opponent will never meet with you. She will never hear your stories. She will never share in your pain.\n\nShe will only meet with the donors and the special interests and the open border advocates.\n\nHer plan calls for total amnesty in the first 100 days, which means Obamacare, Social Security and Medicare for illegal immigrants. Her plan calls for catch-and-release on the border. Sanctuary Cities. Ignoring visa overstays. Closing detention centers. And a virtual end to immigration enforcement in the United States of America.\n\nHillary Clinton has even announced that she plans to go around Congress and implement amnesty by executive order - violating our Constitution and putting the entire nation in grave peril.\n\nHillary Clinton is the first person to ever run for the Presidency of a country effectively proposing to abolish the borders around that country.\n\nBut the media doesn't want you to know any of that. So they'll never ask her any questions about her plan. Like how she'll afford to give lifetime welfare and entitlements to illegal immigrants, or how many people will be victimized because of the illegal immigrants that will be released from federal custody - or at the border. She's not asked to explain what she'll say to the American workers who lose their jobs when she prints out millions of work permits for those here against the law.\n\nYour cause, and your stories, are ignored by our political establishment because they are determined to keep our border open at any cost. To them, your presence is just too inconvenient.\n\nBut help is coming. On November 8th, we are going to win the White House and we are going to deliver justice for every American family and every American victim.\n\nTogether, we will save American lives - and prevent the next thousand American parents from suffering the same fate as the people in the room today.\n\nSince 2013 alone, the Obama Administration has allowed 300,000 criminal aliens to return back into U.S. communities - these are individuals encountered or identified by ICE but who were not detained or processed for deportation.\n\nAccording to the federal government's own data, there are more than 2 million convicted criminal illegal immigrants inside the United States right now. However, this figure does not even include the many individuals who have committed crimes but escaped justice, fled the jurisdiction, or were otherwise never caught. Many crimes committed by people here illegally remain open cases.\n\nAt the same time, hundreds of individuals who have been given visas and refugee admissions into this country have subsequently been charged with terrorism. We are admitting people here with no idea who they are or what they believe.\n\nWhether it's drugs, terrorism or violent crime, our government is utterly failing in its core mission to defend and protect the people of this country. The Border Patrol Agents, who endorsed me, warned that Hillary Clinton's plan would put the entire country in grave danger - they called it radical, deeply dangerous, and warned it would trigger an unprecedented national crisis.\n\nLet's just remember our goal - to prevent the next family from suffering the same terrible fate.\n\nThat is what is at stake in this election.\n\nSo I am now going to invite some of the bravest people I know to come up to the stage and speak.\n\n\n\nThese wounded American families have been alone. But they are alone no longer.\n\nI am here standing with you. The American people are here standing with you. And come November, your long awaited day of justice will finally arrive.\u0000","38":"Hello! Hello, CHCI! It is so great to be back here with so many friends and to see so many young people here because that fits the theme this year: educate, engage, vote. And I can't think of better marching orders for the next 54 days.  And anyone who just heard the congresswoman knows we cannot be on the sidelines. This is the most consequential election in our lifetimes.\nI want to recognize the Institute for all you do to inspire the next generation of Latino leaders. Last year, I had the chance to spend time with some of the CHCI interns and fellows. It really was like seeing the future of America in one room. I can't wait to see everything that they achieve. And I can't wait, if I'm fortunate enough to be president, to put some of them to work!\n\nAnd I want to thank all my friends in the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. You fight every single day to lift up the Latino community - when the cameras are rolling and when the cameras are off, at home in your districts and here in Washington. And no one understands better than you the pivotal moment we're at right now - not just for Latinos but for our country.\n\nMy friends in the caucus have traveled to every battleground state, registered voters. You've stayed focused no matter what kind of outlandish and offensive comments we have heard from my opponent and his supporters. By the way, I personally think a taco truck on every corner sounds absolutely delicious.\n\nNow, here's a confession: Running for president is never easy, but it shouldn't be, right? But tonight I have the ultimate challenge: speaking after President Obama. He's always a tough act to follow, in more ways than one.\n\nI, for one, don't think the President gets the credit he deserves for rescuing our economy from another Great Depression. Think of what we've achieved these last eight years. American businesses have created 15 million new jobs since the recession. Twenty million Americans have health coverage - and no one has seen a bigger drop in uninsured rates under the Affordable Care Act than Latino Americans. We got more good news this week. A report came out showing that poverty is going down, and incomes for American families are going up, and Latino families have seen the biggest increase of all.\n\nNow, that doesn't mean we rest on our laurels by any stretch. Our work is far from finished. But I am more confident than ever that our best days are still ahead of us. I believe with all my heart that the American Dream is alive and it's big enough for everyone to share its promise. That doesn't mean that lots of people are still not hurting, because I know they are. And when you hear a presidential candidate spewing bigotry and hate, it's easy to get discouraged. But we're here because we know this election is a choice between not just two people but two very different visions for our America's future.\n\nEither we're going to make our economy work for everyone, or just those at the top.\n\nEither we're going to fear our differences, or embrace and celebrate our diversity.\n\nEither we're going to pit Americans against each other and deepen the divides, or we're going to be stronger together.\n\nToday, as you know, we're in the midst of Hispanic Heritage Month. In classrooms across America, children will study Dolores Huerta and Cesar Chavez, Julion, and Joaquin Castro, Justice Sotomayor, Roberto Clemente and Laurie Hernandez, Gloria Estefan and Lin-Manuel Miranda, and countless others - names we know and names we might not know, but every one of whom has enriched this country for generations.\n\nWhether you're Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Latin American, Afro-Latino, whether your family just arrived or has been here since before the United States even existed , you're not strangers. You're not intruders. You're our neighbors, our col-leagues, our friends, our families. You make our nation stronger, smarter, more creative. And I want you to know that I see you and I am with you, and time and again - time and again we have seen that when we invest in the community, when we make it possible for Latinos to get the health care you need, get the education you desire, compete for jobs, start new businesses, pursue your dreams, all of America benefits.\n\nAs I said this afternoon in North Carolina, we are in the final stretch of this election. And I intend to close my campaign the way I began my career, fighting for kids and families. That's been the cause of my life. It will be the passion of my presidency. So tonight I want to mention two things I'll do in the first 100 days of my administration to help families in every corner of America.\n\nFirst, we do need to create an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. There's something wrong when Latinos are 17 percent of our country's population but hold only 2 percent of its wealth. We've got to work together to connect more Latinos with good jobs that pay good wages, with more opportunities to get the skills they need, to go to college, to launch new ventures, to build wealth that can be passed on to your kids and your grandkids. So we're going to make, in my first 100 days, the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II, jobs in infrastructure, manufacturing, technology, innovative, clean energy.\n\nAnd we're going to cut red tape and taxes and expand access to capital for small busi-nesses, including the Latino-owned small businesses that create so many jobs and so much growth in communities everywhere. And I want to give a particular shout-out to Latina small business owners. Not everyone knows this, but you are among the fastest-growing group of entrepreneurs in America. And we're going to put families first with new solutions that reflect the way people live and work today. Supporting families with paid family leave, earned sick days, and affordable childcare isn't a luxury, it's a necessity. When families are strong, America is strong.\n\nAnd that brings me to another important family issue. In those first 100 days, I will send a proposal for comprehensive immigration reform to the Congress. My proposal will keep families together, and it will include a path to citizenship. Now, I know this isn't the first time you've heard it. In fact, people have been making the same promise for more than a decade. But I believe with all my heart that some things are too important to give up on. I've been called a lot of things; I've never been called a quitter.\n\nAnd in this election - in this election, we have a chance to show that comprehensive immigration reform isn't just the smart thing to do, it's what the American people demand. And you know how we'll show that? Well, I hope to have a Democratic Congress next January.  But no matter what, on my first day in office I will reach out to Republicans and say, this is your chance to help millions of families and show that your party, the party of Lincoln, is better than Donald Trump.\n\nAnd while we're fighting for comprehensive immigration reform, we're going to keep families together. When the deadlocked Supreme Court put DAPA and expanded DACA on hold for 5 million immigrants, it was devastating to millions of families. But the court didn't actually rule on the substance of the case. And as I've said repeatedly, I believe DAPA and expanded DACA are squarely within the President's authority, and will I protect them and keep fighting for them.\n\nBut in addition to defending DAPA and DACA, there's more we can do. We need a simple, straightforward system where other people with sympathetic cases who are contributing to their communities can make their case and be eligible for deferred action too. Like people who experience and report extreme labor abuses. And we won't stop there. We're going to end family detention, close private detention facilities, and stop the raids and roundups. No child should have to say goodbye to their parents every morning not knowing if their mom or dad will be there when they get home.\n\nSo here's the bottom line. Comprehensive immigration reform will not only be the right thing to do, but it will add $700 billion to our economy and enable America to be what it's always been - a place where people from around the world can come to reunite with family, start new businesses, pursue their dreams, apply their talents to American growth and innovation.\n\nNow, I know this has been a long road and we wouldn't be where we are today without your persistence and the quiet courage of families in every state of our union, and we certainly wouldn't be here without the bravery of the young men and women who have risked their very place in the United States by coming forward and fighting for their own future and the future of millions of others. They helped change the conversation. And when President Obama created DACA, it changed their lives.\n\nRight now, 750,000 undocumented young people in America are going to school, working, and planning for their future. They're DREAMers in much more than name. I've met so many. I've listened to their stories. They've done everything we've asked of them and made our country stronger in return.\n\nSo when Donald Trump promises to rip that all away on Day One, when he promises to round up and deport all of the 16 million people living and working among us, including American citizen children who were born here to parents who are undocumented, these are the faces I see.\n\nI picture Astrid Silva - who I met in Las Vegas. Many of you know her story: She came to this country from Mexico at the age of four with nothing but a doll, a cross, and the dress she was wearing. Now she's in her 20s, advocating for the rights of everywhere.\n\nI picture a young man I never met, whose high school teacher wrote me a few months ago to share his story. His teacher told me that his former student was funny, enthusiastic, and patriotic. He played the drums in the school marching band and after graduation in 2005, proudly enlisted in the U.S. Army. Before shipping off to Iraq, he stopped by the school so everyone could see him in his new uniform.\n\nHe was, his teacher wrote, 'as respectful and optimistic as any student who ever entered my classroom.' He was also a DREAMer, brought here as an undocumented child. He loved America, and hoped one day to earn his citizenship. But in April 2007, while on a mission in Baghdad, he was killed by an improvised explosive device. He was just 19. The Army called him a hero and he was posthumously granted the American citizenship he'd always wanted.\n\nAll these years later - his teacher still treasures his memory. And this teacher wanted me to know - he wanted me to know that despite what Donald Trump may say, immigrants are not rapists and criminals. The truth is, this young man may not have been born here, but he represented the best values of our country.\n\nWe teach our children that America is one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Not just for people who look a certain way or worship a certain way, but for all. Everywhere I go, people tell me how concerned they are by the extreme policies and divisive rhetoric they've heard from my opponent - from the racist lie about Mexican immigrants that launched his presidential campaign to his racist attacks on a federal judge.\n\nAnd every time we think he's hit rock bottom, he sinks even lower. His latest target? A minister in Flint, Michigan who respectfully asked him not to use her pulpit for political attacks. He called her a nervous mess.\n\nHow insulting, how dead wrong. Reverend Faith Green Timmons is not a nervous mess - she's a rock for her community in trying times, and she deserves better and so does America. And again today, he did it again. He was asked one more time, 'Where was President Obama born?' And he still wouldn't still say 'Hawaii.' He still wouldn't say 'America.' This man wants to be our next president? When will he stop this ugliness, this bigotry?\n\nNow, he's tried to reset himself and his campaign many times. This is the best he can do. This is who he is. And so we need to decide who we are. If we just sigh and shake our heads and accept this, then what does that tell our kids about who we are? We need to stand up and repudiate this divisive rhetoric. We need to stop him conclusively in November in an election that sends a message that even he can hear. We need to set the kind of example we want for ourselves and our children and our grandchildren\n\nParents and teachers are already worried about what they're calling the 'Trump Effect.' Bullying and harassment are on the rise in our schools, especially targeting students of color, Muslims, and immigrants.\n\nAt a high school basket game in Indiana, white students held up Trump signs and taunted Latino players on the opposing team with chants of 'Build the wall' and 'Speak English.'\n\nDonald Trump is running the most divisive campaigns of our lifetimes. His message is you should be afraid - afraid of people whose race or ethnicity is different, or whose religious faith is different, or who were born in a different country. There's no innuendo or dog whistles anymore. It's all right out there in the open now. So we've got to come back twice as strong and twice as clear.\n\nJust this week, a mother in Florida wrote to me about her 11-year-old son, Francisco. He's proud to be American, Colombian, Ecuadorian, and Puerto Rican. As he calls it, a 'potluck' of Hispanic heritage. And Francisco has been following this election very closely, his mother told me. He wears his 'Love Trumps Hate' pin every day and refuses to take it off. When his father warned him that might make him a target for bullies, Francisco looked his father in the eye and he said: 'I was always told to stand up for myself and what I believe in. And I believe Trump is wrong.' And good for you, Francisco.\n\nThat's what we have to do in this election, and that's what so many of you are doing already: standing up to the bullying and bigotry wherever it comes from.\n\nTogether, we must send this resounding message, and we need to inspire a level of turnout that will help us win up and down the ticket.\n\nWe've set an ambitious goal of registering and committing 3 million people to vote in this election that would not have otherwise voted, and we can't do it without you. Nearly half of Latinos in America are under 35, and we need you to show up and make your voices heard in this election.\n\nSo we're going to keep asking for your help. Keep hitting the campaign trail. Please talk to your friends, your neighbors, your community - everyone you see between now and November 8th. Tell them to go to hillaryclinton.com, or text JOIN, J-O-I-N to 47246 to get involved. This election is too important for anyone to sit on the sidelines, as we heard from Congresswoman Sanchez.\n\nSo let's stand up for a future where we put families first. Where we build bridges, not walls.\n\nAnd yes, together we can prove love trumps hate. Thank you all very much.\u0000","39":"Thank you, everybody, thank you very much. It's great to be with you this afternoon and today we begin a conversation on how to make America safe again. In the twentieth century, the United States has defeated fascism, Nazism and communism. Now, a different threat faces our world: radical Islamic terrorism.\n\nThis summer, there's been an ISIS attack launched outside the warzones of the Middle East--hard to believe--every eighty-four hours. Here in America, we have seen one brutal attack after another: thirteen were murdered and thirty-eight wounded in the assault on Fort Hood. The Boston Marathon bombing wounded and maimed sixty-four people, and ultimately left five dead, including two of our great police officers . In Chattanooga, Tennessee, five unarmed Marines--unbelievable people, by the way--were shot and killed at a military recruiting center.\n\nLast September, fourteen innocent Americans were gunned down at an office party in San Bernardino; another twenty-two were very gravely injured. In June, forty-nine Americans were executed at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando . Another fifty-three were badly injured. It was the worst mass shooting in our history, and the attack, by far, the worst on the LGBTQ community, and I'll tell you what: we can never, ever allow this to happen again. \n\nIn Europe--thank you--in Europe we have seen the same carnage and bloodshed afflicted upon our closest allies. In January of 2015, a French satirical newspaper, Charlie Hebdo, was attacked for publishing cartoons of the prophet Mohammed. Twelve were killed, including two police officers, and 11 were wounded. Two days later, four were murdered in a Jewish delicatessen. In November of 2015 terrorist went on a shooting rampage in Paris that slaughtered 130 people, and wounded another 368 people, some in very, very, very bad shape today.\n\nFrance is suffering gravely. And the tourism industry is being massively affected in the most negative way. In March of this year terrorists detonated a bomb in Brussels airport killing 32 and injuring 340 people. This July in the South of France an Islamic terrorist turned his truck into an instrument of mass murder, plowing down and killing 85 men, women and children and wounding 308 people.\n\nTerrible. Among the dead were two Americans, a Texas father and his 11-year-old son. A few weeks ago in Germany a refugee armed with an axe wounded 5 people in a gruesome train attack. Only days ago an ISIS killer invaded a Christian Church in Normandy, France forced an 85- year-old priest to his knees. A priest who was beloved, who was beloved; before cutting his throat and just unthinkable other things.\n\nOverseas ISIS has carried out an absolute atrocity and one after another. Children slaughtered, girls sold into slavery, men and women burned alive, crucifixions, beheadings, and drownings, ethnic minorities targeted for mass execution. Holy sites desecrated. Christians driven from their homes and hunted for extermination. ISIS rounding up what it calls 'Nation of the Cross', 'Nation of the Cross' in a campaign of absolute and total genocide.\n\nWe cannot let this evil continue.  Thank you. Thank you.\n\nNor can we let the hateful ideology of radical Islam, it's oppression of women, gays, children and non-believers be allowed to reside or spread within our own countries.  We will defeat radical Islamic terrorism just as we have defeated every threat we've faced at every age and before. But we will not, we will not, remember this, defeat it with closed eyes or silenced voices. We have a president that doesn't want to say the words.\n\nAnyone who cannot name our enemy is not fit to lead our country.  Anyone who cannot condemn the hatred, oppression and violence of radical Islam lacks the moral clarity to serve as our president.  The rise of ISIS is the direct result of policy decisions made by President Obama and Secretary of State Clinton. Let's look back at the Middle East at the very beginning of 2009 before the Obama-Clinton administration took over.\n\nLibya was stable. Syria was under control. Egypt was ruled by a secular president and an ally of the United States.\n\nIraq was experiencing a reduction in violence. The group that would become what we now call ISIS was close to being extinguished. Iran was being choked off by economic sanctions.\n\nFast forward to today. What we have--and think of this--and the decisions made by the Obama\/Clinton group have been absolutely disastrous.\n\nLibya is in ruins. Our ambassador and three other really brave Americans are dead. And ISIS has gained a new base of operations.\n\nSyria is in the midst of a disastrous civil war. ISIS controls large portions of territory. A refugee crisis now threatens Europe and the United States.\n\nIn Egypt, terrorists have gained a foothold in the Sinai desert near the Suez Canal, one of the most essential waterways of the world. Iraq is in chaos. And ISIS is on the loose. ISIS has spread across the Middle East and into the West.\n\nIn 2014, ISIS was operating in seven nations. They were in seven nations. Terrible, but that's what it was.\n\nToday they're fully operational in 18 countries with aspiring branches in six more for a total of 24. And many believe that number is actually 28 to 30 countries. They don't even know.\n\nThe situation is likely worse than the public has any idea. A new congressional report reveals that the Administration has downplayed the growth of ISIS with 40 percent of analysts saying they had experience efforts to manipulate their findings in trying to make it look much better than it is. It's bad.\n\nAt the same time, ISIS is trying to infiltrate refugee flows into Europe and to the United States. Iran, the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism, is not flush with $150 billion in cash released by the United States. Plus if you remember from two weeks ago, another $400 million in actual cash that was obviously used for ransom.\n\nWorst of all, the nuclear deal puts Iran, the number one state sponsor of radical Islamic terrorism, on a path to nuclear weapons. In short, the Obama\/Clinton foreign policy has unleashed ISIS, destabilized the Middle East, and put the nation of Iran, which chants, \"death to America\", in a dominant position of regional power and in fact aspiring a dominant world power.\n\nIt all began in 2009 with what has become known as President Obama's global apology tour. We all remember. We all remember.  In a series of speeches, President Obama described America as arrogant, dismissive, derisive, and a colonial power. He was describing us.\n\nHe informed other countries that he would be speaking up about America's past errors. He pledged that we would no longer be a senior partner that sought to dictate our terms. He lectured CIA officers of the need to acknowledge their mistakes, and described Guantanamo Bay as a rallying cry for our enemies.\n\nPerhaps no speech was more misguided than President Obama's speech to the Muslim world, delivered in Cairo, Egypt, 2009. I remember it well.\n\nIn winning the Cold War, President Ronald Reagan repeatedly touted the superiority of freedom over communism and called the USSR the Evil Empire. Yet when President Obama delivered his address in Cairo, no such moral courage could be found or would be found. Instead of condemning the oppression of women and gays in many Muslim nations, and the systematic violations of human rights, or the financing of global terrorism, President Obama tried to draw an equivalency between our human rights record--and remember this, our human rights--and theirs.\n\nThe records are unbelievable and unmistakable.\n\nHis naive words were followed by even more naive actions. The failure to establish a new status of forces agreement in Iraq and the election-driven timetable for withdrawal surrendered our gains in that country and led directly to the rise of ISIS without question. \n\nThe failures in Iraq were compounded by Hillary Clinton's disaster, total disaster, in Libya. President Obama has since said that he regrets, and really regrets, Libya and the mistake he made. He considers it his worst mistake. According to then-Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, the invasion of Libya was nearly a split decision, but Hillary Clinton's forceful advocacy for the intervention was the deciding factor. That's why we went in.\n\nWith one episode of bad judgment after another, Hillary Clinton's policies launched ISIS onto the world stage. Yet, as she threw the Middle East into violent turmoil, things turned out really to be not so hot for our world and our country. The Middle East in particular.\n\nThe Clintons made almost $60,000 in gross income while she was secretary of state. It is unbelievable. Incident after incident proves again and again Hillary Clinton lacks the judgment--as said by Bernie Sanders--stability and temperament and the moral character to lead our nation. \n\nImportantly, she also lacks the mental and physical stamina to take on ISIS and all of the many adversaries we face. Not only in terrorism, but in trade and every other challenge we must confront to turn our great country around. \n\nIt is now time for a new approach. Our current strategy of nation- building and regime-change is a proven, absolute failure. We have created the vacuums that allow terrorism to grow and thrive. I was an opponent of the Iraq War from the beginning. A major difference between me and my opponent. Though I was a private citizen whose personal opinions on such matters were really not sought, I nonetheless publicly expressed my private doubts about the invasion. I was against, believe me.\n\nThree months before the invasion I said in an interview with Neil Cavuto to whom I offer my best wishes for a speedy recovery, that \"perhaps we shouldn't be doing it yet. And that the economy is a much bigger problem.\"\n\nIn August of 2004, very early, right after the conflict, I made a detailed statement to Esquire Magazine in an interview. Here's the quote in full. \"Look at the war in Iraq and the mess we're in. I would never have handled it that way.\" This was right after the invasion. \"Does anybody really believe that Iraq is going to be a wonderful democracy where people are going to run down to the voting box and gently put in their ballot and the winner is happily going to go and step up and lead the country? C'mon.\"\n\nI then continued, \"Two minutes after we leave there's going to be a revolution and the meanest, toughest, smartest most viscous guy, in this case, guy, will take over. And he'll have weapons of mass destruction which Saddam Hussein did not have.\n\n\"What was the purpose of this whole thing? Hundreds and hundreds of young people killed. And what about the people coming back with no arms and no legs? Not to mention, in all fairness, the other side. The tremendous damage done. All those Iraqi kids who've been blown to pieces. And it turns out that all of the reasons for the war were blatantly wrong. All of this death and destruction for nothing.\"\n\nSo I've been clear for a long time that we should not have gone in. But I have been just as clear in saying what a catastrophic mistake Hillary Clinton and President Obama made with the reckless way in which they pulled out.\n\nAfter we had made those hard fought sacrifices and gains we should have never made such a sudden withdrawal on a timetable advertised to our enemies. They said, we're moving out, here's our time, here's our date. Who would do this but an incompetent president?\n\nAl Qaeda in Iraq had been decimated. And Obama and Clinton gave it new life and allowed it to spread all across the world. By that same token President Obama and Hillary Clinton should have never attempted to build a democracy in Libya, to push for immediate regime change in Syria or to support the overthrow of Mubarak in Egypt.\n\nOne more point on this. I have long said that we should have kept the oil in Iraq.  I said it over and over and over again. Another area where my judgment has been proven correct. I just said it so many times, virtually every time I was interviewed, keep the oil, keep the oil.\n\nAccording to CNN, ISIS made as much as $500,000 in oil sales in 2014 alone. That's before they really got started. Fueling and funding its reign of terror. If we had controlled the oil like I said we should, we could have prevented the rise of ISIS in Iraq, both by cutting off a major source of funding and through the presence of U.S. forces necessary to safeguard the oil and vital infrastructure products necessary for us to have the oil.\n\nI was saying this constantly and consistently to whomever would listen. I said, \"Keep the oil. Keep the oil. Keep the oil. Don't let somebody else get it.\"  If they had listened to me then we would have had the economic benefits of the oil which I wanted to use to help take care of the wounded soldiers and families of those who died in the war.  In addition to which thousands of lives would have been saved. This proposal by its very nature would have left soldiers in place of our assets. We would have had soldiers there guarding this valuable supply of oil. In the old days, when we won a war, to the victor belonged the spoils.  Instead, all we got from Iraq and our ventures in the Middle East, was death, destruction and tremendous financial loss. But it's time to put the mistakes of the past behind us and chart a new course. \n\nIf I become president, the era of nation-building will be brought to a very swift and decisive end.  Thank you. Our new approach--which must be shared by both parties in America, by our allies overseas and by our friends in the Middle East--must be to halt the spread of radical Islam. All actions should be oriented around this goal and any country which shares this goal will be our ally. Very important. Some don't share this goal. We cannot always choose our friends but we can never fail to recognize our enemies. \n\nAs president, I will call for an international conference focused on this goal. We will work side by side with our friends in the Middle East, including our greatest ally Israel.  We will partner with King Abdullah of Jordan and the president of Egypt, President Sisi, and all others who recognize this ideology of death that must be extinguished. \n\nWe will also work very closely with NATO on this new mission. I had previously said that NATO was obsolete because it failed to deal adequately with terrorism. Since my comments, they have changed their policy and now have a new division focused on terror threats. Very good. Very, very good.\n\nI also believe that we could find common ground with Russia in a fight against ISIS. Wouldn't that be a good thing? Wouldn't that be a good thing?  They, too, have much at stake in the outcome in Syria, and have had their own battles with Islamic terrorism just as bad as ours. They have a big, big problem in Russia with ISIS.\n\nMy administration will aggressively pursue joint and coalition military operations to crush and destroy ISIS. International cooperation to cut off their funding. Expanded intelligence sharing, and cyber warfare to disrupt and disable their propaganda and recruiting. Their recruiting is taking place right now, and they're setting records. It's got to be stopped. \n\nWe cannot allow the internet to be used as a recruiting tool and for other purposes by our enemy. We must shut down their access to this form of communication, and we must do it immediately--immediately. \n\nUnlike Hilary Clinton, who has risked so many lives with her careless of handling of sensitive information, my administration will not telegram exactly military plans and what they are.  And by the way, what's happened with her 33,000 e-mails is an absolute disgrace to the United States of America. \n\nIve often said that the great General Douglas MacArthu and the great General George Patton would be in a state of shock if they were alive today to see the way President Obama and Hillary Clinton tried to recklessly announce their every move before it happens. Like they did in Iraq, so that the enemy can prepare and adapt. Their enemy says, Thank you.\n\nThe fight will not be limited to ISIS. We will decimate Al-Qaeda. And we will seek to starve funding for Iran-backed Hamas and Hezbollah.  So important. We can use existing U.N. Security Council resolutions to apply new and even stronger sanctions. Military, cyber and financial warfare will all be necessary to dismantle Islamic terrorism.\n\nBut we must use ideological warfare as well. Very important. And they use it on us, better than we have ever even thought of using it on them. But that will change.\n\nJust as we won, just as we won the Cold War in part by exposing the evils of communism and the virtues of free markets, so too must we take on the ideology of radical Islam. While my opponent accepted millions of dollars in foundation donations from countries where being gay is an offense punishable by prison or death, my administration will speak out against the oppression of women, gays and people of different beliefs. \n\nOur administration would be a friend to all moderate Muslim reformers in the Middle East and will amplify their voices. This includes speaking out against the horrible practice of honor killings, where women are murdered by their relatives for dressing, marrying or acting in a way that violates fundamentalist teachings. Over 1,000 Pakistani girls are estimated to be the victims of honor killings by their relatives each year.\n\nRecently a prominent Pakistani social media star was strangled to death by her brother on the charge of dishonoring the family. In his confession, the brother took pride in the murder and said, \"Girls are born to stay home and follow traditions.\" Shockingly, this is a tradition that has reached our own shores. One such case, and many, many cases have happened--where one involves an Iraqi immigrant who was sentenced to 34 years in jail for running over his own daughter, claiming she had been \"too Westernized.\"\n\nTo defeat Islamic terrorism we must also speak our forcefully against a hateful ideology that provides the breeding ground for violence and terrorism to grow. It's a breeding ground. It's a terrible, terrible breeding ground.\n\nA new immigration policy is needed immediately and as well.  The common thread linking the major Islamic terror attacks that have recently occurred on our soil--9\/11, the Fort Hood shooting, the Boston bombing, the San Bernardino attack, the Orlando attack--is that they have involved immigrants or the children of immigrants.\n\nClearly, new screening procedures are needed. A review by the U.S. Senate Immigration Subcommittee has identified 380 foreign-born individuals charged with terrorism or terrorism-related offenses between 9\/11 and 2014, and many more since then, and this year is a record for identification. It's gotten worse, far worse.\n\nWe also know that ISIS recruits refugees after their entrance into the country, as we have seen with the Somali refugee population in Minnesota.\n\nBeyond terrorism, as we have also seen in France, foreign populations have brought their anti-Semitic attitudes with them. In Cologne, Germany on New Years, we have seen the reports of sexual violence and assault far greater than anybody knows.\n\nPew polling shows that in many of the countries from which we draw large number of immigrants--extreme views about religion such death penalty--and for those who are involved--the death penalty is very, very common if you don't have the faith that they demand you have.\n\nA Trump administration will establish a clear principle that will govern all decisions pertaining to immigration, and we will be tough, and we will be even extreme.  We should only admit into this country those who share our values and respect our people. In the Cold War, we had an ideological screening test. The time is overdue to develop a new screening test for the threats we face today. I call it extreme vetting. I call it extreme--extreme vetting.\n\nOur country has enough problems. We don't need more, and these are problems like we've never had before. ] In addition to screening out all members of the sympathizers we must also screen out any with hostile attitudes toward our country or its principles, or who believe that Sharia law should supplant American law.  Those who do not believe in our Constitution or who support bigotry or hatred will not be admitted for immigration into our country.  Only those who we expect to flourish in our country, and to embrace a tolerant American society should be issued visas.  To put these new procedures in place, we will have to temporarily suspend immigration from some of the most dangerous and volatile regions of the world, that have a history of exporting terrorism, nor for us! Not for us. \n\nThank you. Thank you. As soon as I take office, I will ask the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security to identify a list of regions where adequate screening cannot take place, there are many such regions. We will stop processing visas from those areas until such time as it is deemed safe to resume, based on new circumstances or new procedures. The size of current immigration flows are simply too large to perform adequate screening.  We admit about 100,000 permanent immigrants from the Middle East every year . Beyond that, we admit hundreds of thousands of temporary workers and visitors from the same regions--hundreds of thousands . If we don't control the numbers, we can't perform adequate screening. There's no way it can take place. \n\nBy contrast, my opponent wants to increase--which is unbelievable, no matter who you are, where you come from--wants to increase the flow of Syrian refugees by 550% over what they are now.  The United States Senate Subcommittee on Immigration estimates that Hillary's plan would mean roughly 620,000 refugees from all current refugee-sending nations in her first term , assuming no cuts to other refugee programs--so it could get worse! This would be additional to all other non-refugee immigration. Unbelievable numbers. Unbelievable numbers. The Subcommittee estimates her plan would impose a lifetime cost of roughly $400 billion when you include the cost of healthcare, welfare, housing, schooling and other entitlement benefits that are excluded from the State Department's placement figures. Think of this: $400 billion. In short, Hillary Clinton wants to be America's Angela Merkel.  And you know what a disaster this massive immigration has been to Germany and the people of Germany. Crime has risen to levels that no one thought they would ever, ever see. It is a catastrophe. We have enough problems in our country. We don't need more.\n\nLastly, we will need to restore common sense to our security procedures. Another common feature of the past attacks that have occurred on our soil is that warning signs were totally ignored. The 9\/11 hijackers had fraud all over their visa applications. Almost every one of them. It said practically in big bold letters \"fraud\". And nobody saw it. The Russians warned us about the Boston bombers, here on political asylum, and the attackers were even twice interviewed by the FBI. Very sad.\n\nThe female San Bernardino shooter, on her--on her statements, and everything that she said: she was here on a fiance visa, which most people have not even heard of, from Saudi Arabia, and she wanted to support very openly jihad online. These are the people we're taking in.\n\nA neighbor saw suspicious behavior--bombs on the floor, and other things--but didn't warn authorities because they said they didn't want to be accused of racial profiling. Now, many are dead and many more are gravely wounded.\n\nThe shooter in Orlando reportedly celebrated in his classroom after 9\/11 . He, too, was interviewed by the FBI. His father, a native of Afghanistan, supported the oppressive Taliban regime, and expressed anti-American views very strongly , and by the way, was just seen sitting behind Hillary Clinton with a big fat smile on his face, all the way through her speech.  He obviously liked what she had to say. It's called: weakness, weakness. It's called stupidity, and we've had it. \n\nThe Fort Hood shooter delivered a presentation to a room full of mental health experts before the attacks in which he threw out one red flag after another. He even proclaimed that we \"love death more then you love life\". Not good. These warning signs were ignored because political correctness has replaced common sense in our society.  Thank you. Thank you.\n\nThat is why one of my first acts as president will be to establish a commission on radical Islam, which will include reformers voices in the Muslim community, who will hopefully work with us. We want to build bridges and erase divisions. The goal of the commission will be to identify and explain to the American public the core convictions and beliefs of radical Islam, to identify the warning signs of radicalization, and to expose the networks in our society that support radicalization. This commission will be used to develop new protocols for local police officers, federal investigators and immigration screeners. And while I'm at it, we should give a hand to our great police officers and law enforcement officials.  Thank you. Thank you.\n\nWe will also keep open Guantanamo Bay and place a renewed emphasis on human intelligence. Drone strikes will remain part of our strategy, but we will also seek to capture high-value targets to gain needed information to dismantle their organizations.  Foreign combatants will be tried in military commissions. \n\nFinally, we will pursue aggressive criminal or immigration charges against anyone who lends materiel support to terrorism. There will be consequences for those people. There will be very serious consequences.  Similar to the effort to take down the mafia, this will be the understood mission of every federal investigator and prosecutor in the country.  To accomplish a goal, you must state a mission. The support networks for radical Islam in this country will be stripped out and removed, one-by-one, viciously if necessary--viciously if necessary. Immigration offices will also have their powers restored. Those have been taken away. Those who are guests in our country that are preaching hate will be asked to return home immediately and if they don't immediately, we will return them home.\n\nTo make America safe again, we must work together again. Our victory in the Cold War relied on a bipartisan and international consensus. That is what we must have to defeat radical Islamic terrorism. \n\nBut just like we couldn't defeat communism without acknowledging that communism exists, or explaining its horrible evils, we can't defeat radical Islamic terrorism unless we do the exact same thing. We have to explain that it exists, and explain the difficulties. We have to have a leader that can do that, and we do not have that now.\n\nBut this also means that we have to promote the exceptional virtues of our own way of life. We have an exceptional country, an exceptional way of life. But it's being tread on by sick, sick people. And expecting that as newcomers come into our society, they will likewise have respect and do the same. Pride in our institutions, our history and our values should be taught by parents and teachers and impressed upon all of those that come into our society and want to join our society. \n\nAssimilation is not an act of hostility, but an expression of compassion. Our system of government and our American culture is the best in the world, and we'll produce the best outcomes for all who adopt it.  Thank you. Thank you.\n\nThis approach will not only make us safer, but bring us closer together as a country. Renewing the spirit of Americanism will help heal the divisions in our country, of which there are so many. We have a divider as president. We call him the Great Divider. It's the thing he best.  It will do so by emphasizing what we have in common, not what pulls us apart.\n\nThis is my pledge to the American People: as your president, I will be your single greatest champion. I will fight to ensure that every American is treated equally, protected equally and honored equally.  We will reject bigotry and hatred, and oppression, in all of its ugly forms, and seek a new future built on our common culture and values as one American People. Only this way will we make America great again, and safe again--for everyone. Thank you very much, God bless you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\u0000","40":"Thank you. It's wonderful to be here in Pennsylvania.\nGreat polls keep coming in. A brand new Rasmussen poll has us up 5 points nationwide.\n\nOn November 8th, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House.\n\nWe are going to replace our failed and corrupt establishment with a new government that serves you, your family, and your country.\n\nAt the center of our society is going to be a simple promise to every American: safety.\n\nWe are going to Make America Safe Again.\n\nThe rioting in our streets is a threat to all peaceful citizens. It must be ended.\n\nThe main victims of these violent demonstrations are law-abiding African-Americans who live in these communities and only want to raise their children in peace.\n\nWho is looking out for them?\n\nFor every one violent disruptor, there are thousands of moms and dads in those same communities who just want their kids to be able to walk home safely from school.\n\nTo all our citizens, in all of our inner cities, and all across the country, I say these words to you tonight: I'm with you and I will fight for you.\n\nThe job of a leader is to stand in someone else's shoes and see things from their perspective. Hillary Clinton calls people who don't support her deplorable, and irredeemable. I call anyone who doesn't support me an American citizen who is entitled to equal representation under the law.\n\nI will be a President for all Americans, and I will campaign for every last vote, in every last community.\n\nI will extend my hand to every mayor in this country who wants to be a partner in making our cities safer for their citizens.\n\nBut to do this, we must work with our police - not against our police.\n\nThose peddling the narrative of cops as a racist force in our society - a narrative supported with a nod by my opponent - share directly in the responsibility for the unrest that is afflicting our country and hurting those who have the very least.\n\nLow-income African-Americans in these communities are the ones suffering in terms of lost jobs, lost property values, and lost lives.\n\n65 people have been shot in the city of Chicago alone since Friday.\n\nThe problem is not that there are too many police. The problem is that there are not enough police.\n\nPolice are entrusted with immense responsibility, and we must do everything we can to ensure they are properly trained, that they respect all members of the public, and that any wrongdoing is always vigorously addressed.\n\nBut our men and women in blue also need our support, our thanks, and our gratitude. They are the line separating civilization from chaos.\n\nHillary Clinton does not have to worry about the sirens and the gunshots at night. No, it's the poor family living in the inner city - it's the mother who feels like a refugee in her own country.\n\nWho is there to represent these families?\n\nHillary Clinton doesn't want to hear their voices. So I will be their voice, and I will be a voice for all of the forgotten Americans in this country. People who just want a secure community for their families, good schools for the kids, and a good-paying job to support their loved ones.\n\nWe will bring security to our African-American communities, and to our Latino communities. We will also bring school choice, and new prosperity.\n\nDemocrats have run our inner cities for more than half a century. It's time for change - it's time for a New American Future.\n\nMy economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs.\n\nMy opponent likes to say that for decades, she has been \"fighting for women.\" That she has been \"fighting for children.\" Why then are 70 million American women and children living in poverty, or on the brink of poverty? Why has she provided no relief for the millions of Americans in search of affordable, reliable quality childcare? You know the old saying, \"Watch what I do, not what I say.\"\n\nAt the Trump Organization, and in my campaign for President, women occupy some of the highest positions. I have employed thousands of women in my company. Women of different backgrounds. Women of many talents.\n\nAnd just last week here in Pennsylvania, I was joined by my daughter, Ivanka, and I laid out my plan for childcare and eldercare.\n\nWe have also talked about improving education, and I will talk about it more tonight. A first-class public school education, as well as options for alternatives through charter schools, school choice, and homeschooling, is a right, not a privilege. The opportunity to attend a two or four-year college, or to pursue a trade or a skill set through vocational and technical education, should be easier to access, pay for, and finish. Education is the bedrock of our society.\n\nWomen also value security. They want a Commander-in-Chief that will defeat radical Islamic terrorism and protect our borders. As I campaign across this country, I hear so many stories and pleas, from women especially, about drug addiction and opioid use. They are doing their best in their communities and for their families to provide a safe and nurturing environment.\n\nBut even the best-laid plans cannot always protect our youth, and increasingly, many adults, from the scourge of drugs. We lose thousands of our fellow Americans every year to opioid use. I will stop the drug inflow from our borders. These drugs come over the border and make their way into our urban and rural communities, and into our suburbs.\n\nThis must change. Every change starts with a conversation. Together, we will have this conversation. And we will make this change.\n\nThe changes will start immediately.\n\nOn my first day in office, I am going to immediately begin lifting all regulations that are hurting our workers and our businesses.\n\nThis will unleash a technology revolution. America will become the best place to innovate and to invest in the future. The next great American invention, the next great improvement to our lives, is right around the corner. All we have to do is remove the red tape.\n\nOur plan includes one of the biggest tax reforms in American history. It's going to include a 15% tax rate for all businesses, small and large, making our country a magnet for new jobs.\n\nWe are going to unleash an American Energy Revolution. Oil, coal, natural gas, shale energy, and renewables. This will add at least half a million new jobs every single year.\n\nBut to be a prosperous nation, we need to be a country that makes and builds things in our own country.\n\nThat is why I will direct the Department of Commerce to identify every single violation of our trading rules by our foreign competitors. We will apply every lawful remedy to end these trade abuses.\n\nSteel jobs, and all manufacturing jobs, will be returning to Pennsylvania in a very big way.\n\nYour state has lost one-third of your manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, and one-fourth of your manufacturing jobs since China joined the World Trade Organization. These were both Bill Clinton deals backed by Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe Clintons robbed Pennsylvania, stole your jobs, and shipped them to other countries - we are going to bring them back.\n\nJobs will come flowing back in all over America.\n\nIt used to be that cars were made in Flint and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico. Today, the cars are made in Mexico and you can't drink the water in Flint.\n\nWe're going to turn it all around.\n\nThere's a reason the hedge fund managers are all donating to Hillary Clinton's campaign - and not mine. Everybody getting rich off the rigged system, and who wants nothing to change, are throwing their money at Hillary Clinton.\n\nMy campaign is powered by my own money, and by small dollar donations from everyday patriotic citizens.\n\n95% of our donors are small dollar donations. Every dollar helps us deliver your country back to you - visit DonaldJTrump.com to find out how you can help our movement.\n\nLet me tell you what else we're going to do.\n\nOne of the biggest problems facing young people and families today is the cost of college education. The cost of college has increased by over 500% since 1973.\n\nBut what a lot of people don't know is that universities get massive tax breaks for their massive endowments. These huge multi-billion dollar endowments are tax-free, but too many of these universities don't use the money to help with tuition and student debt.\n\nInstead, these universities use the money to pay their administrators, or put donors' names on buildings, or just store the money away. In fact, many universities spend more on private equity fund managers than tuition programs.\n\nBut they should be using the money on the students - for tuition, for student life, and for student housing.\n\nOn top of that, the federal government spends over $70 billion in higher education every year, plus another $130 billion on federal loans.\n\nHere again, the universities don't use the money to reduce the price of college - but to increase it.\n\nWe have to break this cycle. I'm going to work with Congress on reforms to make sure that if universities want access to all of these special federal tax breaks and tax dollars - paid for by you - that they are making a good faith effort to reduce the cost of college and student debt, and to spend their endowments on their own students.\n\nAnother major issue for all American families is healthcare. President Obama promised Obamacare would reduce the cost of healthcare by $2,500 dollars. Instead, the opposite happened - the cost of healthcare has increased nearly $5,000 dollars during that time.\n\nJust one more Washington lie - like the lie that if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor.\n\nIt's a disaster.\n\nThat is why, on my first day, I am going to ask Congress to immediately send me a bill to repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare.\n\nWe are going to replace government-run Obamacare with reforms that put patients first. These reforms include expanding access to popular Healthcare Savings Accounts, empowering Americans to shop for the insurance of their choice across state lines, and block granting Medicaid to the states so they can design innovative solutions to best serve our most vulnerable citizens.\n\nHillary Clinton, on the other hand, wants to give Obamacare to illegal immigrants and wants a total government takeover of healthcare.\n\nHer plan also gives Social Security and Medicare to illegal immigrants, by making them citizens - bankrupting these programs for Americans.\n\nShe doesn't understand how Democracy works. Public servants are just that - they're there to serve you. But the only people Hillary Clinton has ever served are the special interests.\n\nOur campaign is about breaking-up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We're trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives.\n\nThey're all part of the same political establishment. They go to the same restaurants, they attend the same conferences, they have the same friends and connections. They all support the same ideology of globalism that makes them rich while shipping your jobs, your factories, and your wealth to other countries.\n\nI am not running to be President of the World. I am running to be President of the United States. I Am For America - and America First.\n\nTogether, we will rebuild this country beyond our greatest dreams.\n\nGovernment will start working again. Fixing things is what I do. Just look at my projects in New York, where I turned rundown spaces into new centers of business, activity and opportunity - where others saw only problems, I saw only potential.\n\nWe turned empty lots into homes, offices and living memories for thousands of workers and families.\n\nThat's what I want to do for our country - I want to go into the neglected neighborhoods, the failing schools, the forgotten stretches of this nation, and unlock their potential for all of our people.\n\nI've made a living for years looking at unused spaces and imagining what they could be. Politicians look at blighted neighborhoods and offer only excuses - I look at those same neighborhoods and offer solutions.\n\nWe spend so much time thinking about how things used to be, we've stopped thinking about how great things could be - all we have to do is tune out the doubters, the cynics, and the naysayers.\n\nWe are a nation of strivers, dreamers, and believers - and that's the spirit that will carry us to victory in November, and to great victories as a nation.\n\nIt's that same spirit of resilience I have seen visiting the flood-ravaged towns in Louisiana, or meeting with the incredible but hard-hit people in cities and towns like Flint, Michigan.\n\nIt's that spirit of strength we will need to start winning again as a country.\n\nBut that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th.\n\nYou have to knock on doors.

And Happy Halloween everybody! It's great to be back in Ohio - even if, even if the World Series is making life very stressful for Cubs fans everywhere.\nI want to thank Bruce Blair for that introduction, and for his service to our nation. I think every American should hear your story over the next 8 days before they vote. I also want to thank everyone who was part of the pre-program. In particular, let me thank Senator Sherrod Brown, such a great senator, my dear friend and great congressman Tim Ryan, State Representative John Boccieri, State Representative Kathleen Clyde, and let me thank the Kent Clarks, the acapella group that sang during the pre-program!\n\nMy friends, we are about to enter the final week of this election, so I wanted to come back to Ohio, one of the most competitive and consequential battlegrounds in the country, to talk about what's at stake in this election. But let me start with this. I'm sure a lot of you may be asking what this new email story is about and why in the world the FBI would decide to jump into an election with no evidence of any wrongdoing with just days to go. That's a good question!\n\nAnd first of all, for those of you who are concerned about my using personal email, I understand and as I've said, I'm not making excuses. I said it was a mistake and I regret it and now they apparently want to look at emails of one of my staffers and by all means, they should look at them. And I am sure they will reach the same conclusion they did when they looked at my emails for the last year. There is no case here. And they said it wasn't even a close call and I think most people have decided a long time ago what they think about all of this.\n\nNow what people are focused on is choosing the next President and Commander-in-Chief of the United States of America. And did any of you see the debates? Well, I think it was important because I had a chance to talk about my 30 years of public service and my plans for our country. And then people could weigh that against what my opponent has done and said. I am running against a man who says he doesn't understand why we can't use nuclear weapons. He actually said, 'Then why are we making them?' And he wants more countries to have nuclear weapons. Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia. Imagine nuclear weapons smack in the middle of the Middle East.\n\nAnd if you're telling yourself he'll surround himself with smart people who'll stop these crazy ideas, remember this: When he asked who he consults on foreign policy, Donald Trump said he didn't need to consult because he said and I quote, 'I have a very good brain.' He said he knows more about ISIS than our generals do. No, he does not. And of course, the people Donald Trump has had around him include two men whose activities are reportedly being investigated for their ties to Russia -- Vladimir Putin and Putin's allies.\n\nSo, in these last days, let's not get distracted from the real choice in this election and the consequences for your future. I started saying last June, I believe, that Donald Trump has proven himself temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be President and Commander-in-Chief. And I've got to tell you, I did not take any pleasure in saying that. I have known, I have known for years now people who ran for President, Republicans and Democrats. And I had my differences with Republicans and even with Democrats, but I never doubted their fitness to serve. Donald Trump is different. That's as serious as it gets.\n\nSo today, I want to talk about our national security. Because when the election is over and people wake up on November 9th, we will have picked the person who will carry the responsibility for all these weighty decisions. And that should really convince anyone how high the stakes really are in this election. And I just want to focus on three of the most crucial questions facing the next President: Can you be trusted to command our nuclear arsenal and make literally life and death decisions about war and peace? How do you handle a crisis? And do you know the difference between our allies and our adversaries?\n\nWe'll start with nuclear weapons. Now, I know there are some who will say that any discussion of this topic could be fear-mongering, but I don't think so and in part of what you just heard from Bruce Blair. When dozens of retired nuclear launch officers publicly state that Donald Trump should, and I quote, 'not have his finger on the button,' then this is a topic that can't be avoided. And as I've said, Donald has repeatedly suggested that more countries should have nuclear weapons. He must not realize or care that the more nuclear material there is in the world, the more likely terrorists are to get their hands on it -- or that someone will miscalculate and start a war that can't be stopped. And when a few more countries go nuclear, their neighbors will feel pressure to do so as well.\n\nOne of the reasons I worked so hard to impose sanctions on Iran so that we could get them to the negotiating table was so we would not have a nuclear arms race in the Middle East and I am proud that we put a lid on Iran's nuclear weapons program. But even the prospect of an actual nuclear war doesn't seem to bother Donald Trump. 'Good luck, enjoy yourselves, folks,' was what he had to say about a potential nuclear conflict in Asia.\n\nI wonder if he knows that a single nuclear warhead can kill millions of people. These are weapons today far more powerful than the bombs that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II.\n\nTo talk so casually, so cavalierly about mass annihilation is truly appalling. President Ronald Reagan once said -- and he worked hard for arms control and I admired what he did working with the Soviet Union -- and he once said he feared, and this is a quote from President Reagan, 'some fool or some maniac or some accident triggering the kind of war that is the end of the line for all of us.' That has been the fear and the commitment of Democratic and Republican presidents since the dawn of the Atomic Age.\n\nSo what would he think about Donald Trump, who says he wants to be, and I quote, 'unpredictable' about using the most powerful weapons ever produced? And here's the thing with nuclear weapons - as Bruce told you, when the President gives the order, that's it. There's no veto for Congress, no veto by the Joint Chiefs. The officers in the silos have no choice but to fire. And that can take as little as four minutes. That's why all those retired launch officers stepped forward and said Donald Trump should never be put in charge of our nuclear arsenal.\n\nEarlier you heard from one of them, Bruce Blair, and his story is worth remembering. In 1973, Bruce was a young military officer working in an underground bunker in Montana. His job was to launch as many as 50 nuclear weapons if the President ever gave the order. Then one night in October, as the United States and the Soviet Union squared off over an escalating conflict in the Middle East, the emergency message he had trained for arrived: prepare for nuclear war. Like other American officers in bunkers and submarines and bombers around the world, Bruce and his colleagues started the process because that was their duty. They unlocked the safe, took out the launch codes and the keys, and then strapped into their chairs to brace for the shockwaves that would come if a Russian warhead detonated above them. Then they waited for the final order from the President. Thankfully, it never came. But when Bruce looks at Donald Trump, and sees his hair-trigger temper, and he thinks about what it felt like inside that bunker that night. As I've said many times, a man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.\n\nAnd that brings me to the second question I think voters should pose to both candidates: How do you handle a crisis? We've seen in this campaign that Donald Trump loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When he's gotten a tough question from a reporter. When he's challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. When he's confronted with his own words. So imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. Imagine his advisors afraid to tell him what he doesn't want to hear, racing against his legendarily short attention span to lay out life-and-death choices too complex to be reduced to a single tweet. And then imagine him plunging us into a war because somebody got under his very thin skin.\n\nNow thankfully, he's never been in a position where he had to help make life-and-death decisions for our country. But there was one national crisis where we did get a good look at how Donald Trump handles himself. Donald is a New Yorker, and his finest moment in this campaign was when he defended New York against Ted Cruz's attacks in a debate. And then he invoked the days after 9\/11, when New Yorkers really came together and took care of each other. And I couldn't agree more. That's why it was so upsetting to learn what Donald was actually doing on 9\/11. After the world watched with horror as the Twin Towers fell, he called in to a New York TV station. And even on that horrible day, when thousands of people lost their lives, he couldn't stop himself from pointing out that now, because the towers had fallen, a building he owned was now the tallest in Lower Manhattan. What kind of a person brags at a moment like that? I'll tell you: someone who should never set foot in the Oval Office and serve as Commander in Chief.\n\nFor me, I take this very personally, my friends. Because I was one of New York's senators along with Chuck Schumer on 9\/11. He and I were on the ground the very next day, meeting with the Governor, the Mayor, emergency officials. And I will never forget the sight of Ground Zero. The thick smoke made it hard to breathe or see. Some of the firefighters and other first responders we met had been on duty nonstop since the planes hit the towers. They had all lost friends. In a makeshift command center, we were briefed on the damage, and it was clear we were going to need a lot of help to recover New York, and we were going to have to really make it our absolute mission to not only rebuild New York but to keep America safe.\n\nThat's what I did for eight years as a senator. I never stopped fighting to keep our country safer and to ensure that first responders got the medical care they needed. And I think it's important to reflect on what each of us has done in moments like that. Because a lot of the crises that come at a president are not predicted. They happen. I'll tell you a quick story. It was after President-elect Obama asked me to be secretary of state but before the inauguration. And I got a call to come to an emergency meeting in the White House in the Situation Room. And the new Obama national security team was on one side of table, and the outgoing Bush national security team was on the other side. And the Bush Administration had gotten credible intelligence that there was going to be an attack at our inauguration.\n\nSo even before we were sworn in to do our jobs, we were faced with helping to make such a consequential decision. It really matters what your experience has, what your values are, whether you can be counted on to make that decision. You learn a lot about people in moments like that. And as I sat there with the pressure on, having to think through in my own head, how we evaluated this intelligence, how we did everything we could to preserve our inauguration of our first African American president on the Mall in Washington.\n\nWe made the decision to go forward, obviously. Some of you might have been there. But we also did everything we could to double our efforts to find out about the intelligence and to secure the hundreds of thousands of people who would be there. So you have to ask yourself: in a crisis, who would you trust? Who will listen to good advice, keep a level head and make the right call? Because that's the person you want as our president and Commander in Chief.\n\nNow let's get to the third question for all of the voters to consider about each of us. Do you know the difference between our allies and our adversaries? Now this may seem like an easy question. If you got it on an exam, I think you'd be able to answer it. But apparently it's hard for Donald. He has picked fights with our friends. I mean the President of Mexico, the British prime minister, the German chancellor, pretty much the entire nation of Japan- and he even picked a fight with the Pope. And at the same time he is praising tyrants and dictators like Saddam Hussein and Kim Jong Un in North Korea and Bashar al-Assad for their supposed strong leadership. He even praised the Chinese government for massacring protesters in Tiananmen Square. Trump has repeatedly suggested he would abandon our allies in Europe and Asia.\n\nHe has called NATO, quote, 'obsolete.' Obsolete? NATO is the greatest military alliance in the history of the world. And it's based on something called Article V, which says, 'An attack on one is an attack on all.' And Article V has only been invoked one time: when our allies came to our defense after 9\/11. We still have NATO allies fighting side by side, working side by side with American troops in Afghanistan. They joined us in going after Al Qaeda and Bin Laden. Now we're supposed to tell them we won't have their back?\n\nAnd by the way-right now, our NATO allies are helping identify and track terrorists who threaten America and Europe. They're hosting radar and missile defense installations that protect us against potential threats from Iran and elsewhere. And as our NATO forces in Afghanistan stand shoulder-to-shoulder with American troops, they share the risks and burdens. Now they're moving into the Baltic States to deter Russian aggression.\n\nTreating our allies like the small businesses and contractors that Trump exploited and stiffed in Atlantic City - hanging them out to dry -- would make our country and our world less safe. And it would play right into the hands of Russia and China, which are envious of our alliances and eager to see them weaken or fail. But maybe that's the point. Because what's most striking about all of this -- and I would argue most important for voters to consider - is the relationship between Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nAs former Secretary Madeleine Albright put it, and I quote her, 'We have never seen a mind meld of the kind between the Russian leadership and a candidate for the presidency of the United States.' Michael Morell, who ran the CIA and grew up just a few miles from here, has said that Putin is manipulating Donald. Putin is a trained intelligence officer from the old KGB. He knows he can use flattery to get into Donald's head -- to make Donald the Kremlin's puppet. And It seems to be working.\n\nDonald has signaled to Putin that he will let Russia do whatever it wants, from Ukraine to Syria and beyond. He's even said Putin is a stronger leader than President Obama. And it gets worse. The U.S. intelligence community has now confirmed that the Russian government, which means Putin, is directing cyber-attacks against targets in the United States to influence the outcome of our election.\n\nSo ask yourself, why would Putin be trying to get Donald Trump elected President? Could it be because of all of the nice things Donald has said about him, or the fact that he's promised to adopt pro-Kremlin policies, or maybe because of his extensive business dealings with Russian oligarchs with ties to Putin? Since Donald still won't release his tax returns, and don't hold your breath, we don't know the full extent of his business relationships --but what we do know is disturbing.\n\nAnd we know this: We are dealing with something unprecedented in the history of our country. A foreign adversary trying to influence our presidential election. That should scare everyone, Democrat, Republican, and Independent. With the election just eight days away, this can't wait any longer. Donald Trump should immediately disclose all of his ties and connections to the Kremlin and its associates. The American people deserve to know the full extent of these links and how they relate to what the Russians are doing in our election.\n\nWhen you step back and take it all in, it's no surprise that 50 Republican national security experts wrote an open letter saying that they will not vote for Donald Trump, because he would be - in their words - 'the most reckless President in American history.' It's no surprise that not a single former President, Secretary of State or Defense, or National Security Advisor from either party has endorsed him. It's no surprise that Bob Gates, who served eight presidents over 50 years, Democrats and Republicans alike, has said Trump is, and I quote, 'beyond repair- stubbornly uninformed about the world and how to lead our country and government- temperamentally unsuited to lead our men and women in uniform- unqualified and unfit to be commander-in-chief.'\n\nI hope you and voters across Ohio and America will think about all of these national security issues when you cast your vote in this election. Think about what it takes to lead -- and how we want to secure the safety of our country, our children and our grandchildren. And who is best to do that. So make no mistake, that really is what is on the ballot this year. It's not just my name and Donald Trump's name. It's our future. Our security. Our values. It's who we are as a country.\n\nDonald Trump has a dark and divisive vision for America that could tear our country apart. But the good news is: There's another vision for America. Instead of dark and divisive, it's hopeful and inclusive and optimistic and unified. And it is big-hearted, not small-minded. It's about lifting people up, not tearing each other down. It's a vision that says, as I believe in my heart that we are stronger together.\n\nMillions of people across our country are standing up and saying: We believe in an America that is great because it is good. That is Democrats, Republicans and Independents. Because we believe in an America where women are respected. An America where veterans are honored, parents are supported, and workers are paid fairly - an America where marriage is a right and discrimination is wrong-. an America that leads in the world and lives up to our values- where everyone counts and everyone has a place. Where the American dream is big enough for everyone.\n\nThis goes way beyond policies and partisanship. We're talking about what it really means to be an American in the 21st century. About the basic lessons we want to teach boys and girls, kids and grandkids. It turns out, if you dig deep enough, through all the mud of politics, eventually you hit something hard and true. A foundation of fundamental values that unite us as Americans - basic beliefs about equality and opportunity and freedom and common decency.\n\nThat's something to defend - and to build on. And, in the end, that's what this election is all about. Here in Ohio, you can make the difference. Early voting has already begun. So now is the time. Every phone call you make, every door you knock, moves us forward. You can go to hillaryclinton.com, and sign up to volunteer. Or text J-O-I-N to 4-7-2-4-6 to do the same.\n\nSometimes -- if you have studied history -- you know the fate of the greatest nations comes down to single moments in time. This is one of those make-or-break moments for the United States. And it truly is in your hands, as it should be. When your kids and grandkids ask you what you did in 2016, when everything was on the line, I hope you will be able to say: I voted for a better, stronger, fairer America. A place where our future will be created and charted by people will have confidence that that the best days of America are still ahead of us. Particularly young people who I believe absolutely should help make that future!\n\nSo let's come together, let us make clear that we are going to stand up for an America that we believe in because that America believes in us. And we are going to prove once and for all that love trumps hate. Thank you.\u0000","42":"The silent majority is back. In 10 days, we are going to win the state of Arizona and we are going to win back the White House.\nA Trump Administration will immediately repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.\n\nIt's just been announced that the citizens of Arizona are going to experience a 116 percent increase in their Obamacare premiums. Elect me, and WE WILL STOP THE PREMIUM HIKES FOR GOOD. WE WILL STOP THE MADNESS OF OBAMACARE.\n\nEvery single one of Arizona's 15 counties is losing insurers next year because of Obamacare. In Phoenix, there are 8 Obamacare insurers this year. Next year there will be only one. And it was announced this week that Obamacare premiums in Phoenix will go up 145% next year. One insurer in the state will have a $14,000 deductible.\n\nObamacare is a catastrophe for Arizona, and a catastrophe for all of America.\n\nEven Bill Clinton admitted Obamacare is \"the craziest thing in the world,\" where \"people wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half.\"\n\nIn Minnesota, where the premium increase will be close to 60 percent, the Democratic Governor has said \"the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable.\"\n\nJonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, admitted it was all a fraud, and he said, outrageously, that it was passed because of the \"stupidity of the American voter.\"\n\nHillary Clinton wants to double-down on Obamacare, making it even more expensive.\n\nMy Contract With the American Voter outlines a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare, and I'm asking for your vote so we can save healthcare for every family in Arizona.\n\nReal change also means getting rid of the corruption in Washington.\n\nAs you have heard, it was just announced yesterday that the FBI is reopening their investigation into the criminal and illegal conduct of Hillary Clinton.\n\nThis is the biggest political scandal since Watergate, and it is everybody's deepest hope that justice, at last, can be delivered.\n\nHillary has nobody but herself to blame for her mounting legal troubles. Her criminal action was willful, deliberate, intentional, and purposeful.\n\nHillary set-up an illegal server for the obvious purpose of shielding her criminal conduct from public disclosure - and exposure.\n\nShe set-up this illegal server knowing full well that her actions put our national security at risk, and put the safety and security of your children at risk. But she didn't care - as long as she and Bill got the money, the safety of your family didn't matter.\n\nTo cover-up her crimes, she bleached and deleted 33,000 emails after receiving a Congressional Subpoena, made 13 phones disappear - some with a hammer, lied to Congress under oath, lied to the FBI many times, and then two boxes of email evidence went mysteriously missing.\n\nThe WikiLeaks revelations have exposed criminal corruption at the highest levels of our government.\n\nHillary put the office of Secretary of State up for sale and, if she ever got the chance, she'd put the Oval Office up for sale too. She'd put it up for sale to special interests and foreign dictators - whoever offers the highest price.\n\nYet, now it's reported that the Department of Justice is fighting the FBI - that's because the Department of Justice is trying to protect Hillary Clinton.\n\n97% of Department of Justice employee's presidential contributions went to Hillary Clinton.\n\nThere are those, and I happen to be one of them, who think Hillary offered Lorretta Lynch a reappointment as Attorney General if she were to become President. Perhaps that was what Bill Clinton was arranging when he met with Attorney General Lynch on her airplane on the tarmac right here in Arizona.\n\nThis is what we mean when we say the system is rigged.\n\nA vote for Hillary is a vote to surrender our government to public corruption, graft and cronyism that threatens the survival of our Constitutional system itself.\n\nWhat makes us exceptional is that we are a nation of laws, and that we are all equal under those laws - Hillary's corruption shreds the principle on which our nation was founded.\n\nGovernment corruption spreads outward, like a cancer, infecting the whole operation of our government.\n\nWhen the outcome is fixed, when the system is rigged, people lose hope - they stop dreaming, they stop trying.\n\nWhen the powerful can get away with anything, because they have the money and the connections to rig the system, then people lose confidence in our laws and in our future.\n\nHillary's corruption is corrosive to the soul of our nation, and it must be stopped.\n\nAs FDR once said, \"government by organized money is just as dangerous as government by organized mob.\"\n\nHillary believes money and power - not truth and justice - should rule the day.\n\nWe have one ultimate check on Hillary's corruption, and that is the power of voting. The only way to beat the corruption is to show up and vote by the tens of millions, including millions of people voting for the first time in their entire lives.\n\nVote with all of your heart and soul to Make America Great Again.\n\nRestoring honesty to our government, and the rule of law to our society, will be my highest priority as President.\n\nHaven't we had enough drama with the Clintons? Bill Clinton was impeached for lying and obstructing justice, signed the worst trade deal in history, NAFTA, which emptied our country of it's manufacturing jobs, and he doesn't even have the right to practice law.\n\nHillary has brought scandal or destroyed everything she touched.\n\nLook at Whitewater, cattle futures, jobs in Upstate New York, or look at Syria, Iraq, Libya, and now her emails.\n\nThis will be the year the American people say: enough is enough.\n\nThis will be the year the American people break with the bitter failures of the past and embrace a new and optimistic future.\n\nMy Contract With The American Voter begins with a plan to end government corruption.\n\nI want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and to heed the words we are all about to say.\n\nWhen we win on November 8th, We Are Going To Washington, D.C. And We Are Going To DRAIN THE SWAMP.\n\nAt the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs.\n\nRight now, 70 million American women and children live in poverty, or near the brink of poverty.\n\nAmerica has lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs since Bill and Hillary's NAFTA. America has lost 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization.\n\nWe are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. Hillary's goal is to send millions and millions more jobs out of our country.\n\nHillary is going to raise taxes up to 45 percent, massively expand regulation, shut down American energy, and push through terrible trade deals that offshore our jobs for the benefit of her donors.\n\nHer policies will cause a major recession, or even a depression.\n\nA Trump Administration will stop TPP, renegotiate NAFTA, and we are going to stand up to China on Currency Manipulation.\n\nWe are going to lower taxes on American business from 35 percent to 15 percent.\n\nWe are going to cut taxes for Middle Class families by hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\nMy infrastructure plan will provide help for projects like the proposed Interstate-11, which would connect Phoenix with Las Vegas and other areas.\n\nWe will also unleash the full power of American energy including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal.\n\nWe will become a rich nation once again.\n\nBut to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country.\n\nA Trump Administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. And yes, we will build a wall.\n\nWe have the endorsement of America's ICE and Border Patrol Officers, the first time they have ever made an endorsement.\n\nWhen Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State she allowed thousands of the most dangerous criminal aliens in the world to go free inside America because their home countries wouldn't take them back.\n\nThese were people guilty of murder, assault, rape, and all manner of violent crime.\n\nHillary has pledged \"open borders,\" and supports Sanctuary Cities.\n\nCountless Americans are killed by illegal immigrants because our government won't do it's job.\n\nThese include amazing Americans like Sergeant Brandon Mendoza, of Mesa Arizona, who was killed by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record who should have been deported - but the government refused to act. I've spent time with his incredible mother.\n\n28-year-old Park Ranger Kris Eggle was shot and killed by a drug cartel hit squad responsible for a number of murders. Kris died trying to protect our borders from drug and weapon trafficking into the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument.\n\n33-year-old Phoenix Police Officer Nick Erfle, a young cancer survivor, was murdered by a previously- deported illegal immigrant with a felony warrant. Nick was shot twice in the back of the head.\n\n21-year-old Grant Ronnebeck, was working at a convenience store in Mesa Arizona when he was shot point blank by an illegal immigrant.\n\nHis illegal immigrant killer, despite a criminal record, was out on bond, roaming free.\n\nWhen I become President, this crime wave ends.\n\nWe are going to cancel all federal funding for Sanctuary Cities.\n\nWe are going to impose tough prison sentences for illegal immigrants who return after a previous deportation.\n\nWe will end illegal immigration, deport every last criminal alien, and save American lives.\n\nWe will also repeal the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military. We have the endorsements of over 200 Admirals and Generals and 22 Medal of Honor Recipients.\n\nOur Air Force is the smallest and oldest it has ever been, and my plan builds the modern, advanced fighter aircraft we need - fighters like those that will be stationed at Luke Air Force Base.\n\nOur Army is the smallest it has been since before World War II, and we will significantly increase both the size of our Army and the emphasis we place on intelligence - that means supporting the men and women at Fort Huachuca, home of the Army's Intelligence Center.\n\nPlaces like Marine Corps Air Station Yuma will have new aircraft - they won't have to get spare parts from museums anymore.\n\nWe also need a new foreign policy that puts America First.\n\nHillary's policies unleashed ISIS, empowered Iran, and spread death and destruction across the Middle East.\n\nHillary and our failed Washington Establishment have spent $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East, and now it's in worse shape than ever before.\n\nOur failed establishment has betrayed the American worker and family. They've dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe, they have left our borders wide open at home, and they've shipped our jobs and wealth to other countries.\n\nTo all Americans I say: it is time for new leadership.\n\nJust think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days -\n\nWe are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation; cancel every illegal Obama executive order; stop the massive inflow of refugees and keep Radical Islamic Terrorist out of our country; rebuild our military and take care of our Vets; reduce surging crime and support the men and women of law enforcement; provide school choice and put an end to Common Core; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\n\nAmericans are tired of being told by politicians that they have to defer their dreams to another day, but they really mean another decade.\n\nHillary has been there for 30 years, and she has accomplished nothing - she's just made things worse.\n\nShe is the candidate of yesterday. We are the movement of the future.\n\nOur movement represents all Americans, from all backgrounds, and all walks of life. We are asking for the votes of Republicans, Democrats, Independents, and first-time voters.\n\nWe are fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people - not the donors and special interests.\n\nWe are fighting to unlock the potential of every American community, and every American family, who yearns for a better future.\n\nWith your vote, we are just 10 days away from the change you've been waiting for your entire life.\n\nTogether, We Will Make America JUST Again.\n\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\n\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\n\nAnd We Will Make America Great Again.\u0000","43":"Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you.\nToday, I'm going to outline a plan for American economic revival - it is a bold, ambitious, forward-looking plan to massively increase jobs, wages, incomes and opportunities for the people of our country.\n\nMy plan will embrace the truth that people flourish under a minimum government burden, and it will tap into the incredible unrealized potential of our workers and their dreams.\n\nRight now, 92 million Americans are on the sidelines, outside the workforce, and not part of our economy. It's a silent nation of jobless Americans.\n\nLook no further than the city of Flint, where I just visited. The jobs have stripped from this community, and its infrastructure has collapsed. In 1970, there were more than 80,000 people in Flint working for GM - today it is less than 8,000. Now Ford has announced it is moving all small car production to Mexico.\n\nIt used to be cars were made in Flint and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico. Now, the cars are made in Mexico and you can't drink the water in Flint.\n\nWe are going to turn this around.\n\nMy economic plan rejects the cynicism that says our labor force will keep declining, that our jobs will keep leaving, and that our economy can never grow as it did once before.\n\nWe reject the pessimism that says our standard of living can no longer rise, and that all that's left to do is divide up and redistribute our shrinking resources.\n\nEverything that is broken today can be fixed, and every failure can be turned into a great success.\n\nJobs can stop leaving our country, and start pouring in. Failing schools can become flourishing schools. Crumbling roads and bridges can become gleaming new infrastructure. Inner cities can experience a flood of new jobs and investment. And rising crime can give way to safe and prosperous communities.\n\nAll of these things, and so much more, are possible. But to accomplish them, we must replace the present policy of globalism - which has moved so many jobs and so much wealth out of our country - and replace it with a new policy of Americanism.\n\nUnder this American System, every policy decision we make must pass a simple test: does it create more jobs and better wages for Americans?\n\nIf we lower our taxes, remove destructive regulations, unleash the vast treasure of American energy, and negotiate trade deals that put America First, then there is no limit to the number of jobs we can create and the amount of prosperity we can unleash.\n\nAmerica will truly be the greatest place in the world to invest, hire, grow and to create new jobs, new technologies, and entire new industries.\n\nInstead of driving jobs and wealth away, America will become the world's great magnet for innovation and job creation.\n\nMy opponent's plan rejects this optimism. She offers only more taxing, regulating, more spending and more wealth redistribution - a future of slow growth, declining incomes, and dwindling prosperity.\n\nThe only people who get rich under Hillary Clinton's scheme are the donors and the special interests.\n\nIn Hillary Clinton's America, we have surrendered our status as the world's great economy, and we have surrendered our middle class to the whims of foreign countries.\n\nNot one single idea she has will create one net American job, or create one new dollar of American wealth for our workers. The only thing she can ever offer is a welfare check. Our plan will produce paychecks, and they're going to be great paychecks for millions of people now unemployed.\n\nIn the course of this campaign, I have travelled all across this country and I've met the most amazing people. Every day, I've seen the goodness and character of our country, and brave citizens proudly fighting through hard times and difficult circumstances.\n\nIn many parts of our country, the hard times never seem to end. I've visited cities and towns in upstate New York where half the jobs have left and moved to other countries.\n\nPoliticians have abandoned these places all over our country and the people who live there.\n\nWorse still, politicians have heaped scorn and disdain on these wonderful Americans. My opponent described tens of millions of American citizens as deplorable and irredeemable - how can Hillary Clinton seek to lead this country when she considers its citizens beyond redemption?\n\nThe hardworking people she calls deplorable are the most admirable people I know: they are cops and soldiers, teachers and firefighters, young and old, moms and dads, blacks, whites and Latinos - but above everything else, they are all American. They love their families, they love their country, and they want a better future.\n\nThese are the forgotten men and women of America. People who work hard but don't have a voice.\n\nI am running to be their voice, and to fight to bring prosperity to every part of this country.\n\nToo many of our leaders have forgotten that it's their duty to protect the jobs, wages and well-being of American workers before any other consideration.\n\nI'm not running to be President of the world. I'm running to be President of the United States - and as your President, I will fight for every last American job.\n\nWe are the nation that tamed the West, dug out the Panama Canal, won two World Wars, and put a man on the moon.\n\nIt's time to start thinking big once again.\n\nThat's why I believe it is time to establish a national goal of reaching 4% economic growth.\n\nIn working with my economic team, we've put together a plan that puts us on track to achieve that goal. Over the next ten years, our economic team estimates that under our plan the economy will average 3.5% growth and create a total of 25 million new jobs. You can visit our website to see the math.\n\nThis growth means that our jobs plan, including our childcare reforms, will be completely paid-for in combination with proposed budget savings.\n\nIt will be deficit neutral. If we reach 4% growth, it will reduce the deficit.\n\nIt will be accomplished through a complete overhaul of our tax, regulatory, energy and trade policies.\n\nRight now, under Obama-Clinton policies, the economy grew only 1.1 percent last quarter - that translates to millions of lost jobs.\n\nThis is the weakest so-called recovery since the Great Depression.\n\nOver the last 7 years, the economy grew only 2.1 percent, the slowest period in seventy years. Had the economy grown under Obama at the same rate as Reagan, it would have meant 10 million more jobs.\n\nPerhaps most shockingly, 1 in 6 men aged 18-34 are either in jail or out of work.\n\nMeanwhile, another 2 million Hispanic-Americans have been added to the ranks of those in poverty.\n\nOn top of it all, the Obama-Clinton policies have doubled the national debt. It took more than 230 years for the United States to accumulate it's first $10 trillion dollars in debt - it took President Obama only eight years to add another $10 trillion.\n\nNow, it would be one thing if that money had been used to completely rebuild our nation, our military, and our infrastructure.\n\nInstead, the opposite happened. We doubled our debt and, in return, we have dilapidated infrastructure, failing schools, a badly depleted military, and another 14 million people who have left the workforce.\n\nNever has so much money been spent so poorly.\n\nBut we're going to turn that all around. Here's how.\n\nIt begins with bold new tax reform.\n\nAs outlined in Detroit, our tax plan will greatly simplify the code and reduce the number of brackets from 7 to 3. The 3 new brackets will be 12, 25 and 33, but low-income Americans will pay no income tax at all - in fact, our plan will remove millions and millions of workers from the income tax rolls entirely.\n\nBy lowering rates, streamlining deductions, and simplifying the process, we will add millions of new jobs.\n\nIn addition, because we have strongly capped deductions for the wealthy and closed special interest loopholes, the tax relief will be concentrated on the working and middle class taxpayer. They will receive the biggest benefit - it won't even be close.\n\nThis is a working and middle class tax relief proposal.\n\nThe tax relief for these workers will be expanded by my childcare proposals that I have worked on with my daughter, Ivanka.\n\nThese proposals are a central element of our comprehensive tax reform and economic growth plan.\n\nFamilies will be able to fully deduct the average cost of childcare from their taxes, including stay-at-home parents. Because this deduction is capped, it will disproportionately benefit working and middle class families. The less you make, the larger a share of your income you can exclude from taxation.\n\nParents will also be able to enroll in tax-free dependent care savings accounts for their children or elderly relatives. Low-income households will benefit from both an Expanded Earned Income Tax Credit - in the form a Childcare rebate - and a matching $500 contribution for their savings accounts.\n\nA married couple earning $50,000 per year with two children and $8,000 in child care expenses will save 35% from their current tax bill.\n\nA married couple earning $75,000 per year with two children and $10,000 in child care expenses will receive a 30% reduction in their tax bill.\n\nBy contrast, someone earning $5 million will receive virtually no change in their tax bill at all.\n\nOne of our greatest job creation measures is going to be our 15% business tax rate - down from the current 35% rate, a reduction of more than 40 percent. An explosion of new business and new jobs will be created. It will be amazing to watch.\n\nWe will also allow U.S.-based manufacturers to fully expense the cost of new plants and equipment.\n\nOn top of that, we will bring back trillions in business wealth parked overseas and tax it at a 10% rate. Some people say there are $2 trillion dollars overseas, I think it's $5 trillion. By taxing it at 10% instead of 35%, all of this money will come back into our country.\n\nWe will turn America into a magnet for new jobs - and that means jobs in our poorest communities.\n\nNext, comes regulations.\n\nOne of the keys to unlocking growth is scaling-back years of disastrous regulations unilaterally imposed by our out-of-control bureaucracy.\n\nRegulations have grown into a massive, job-killing industry - and the regulation industry is one business I will put an end to.\n\nIn 2015 alone, federal agencies issued over 3,300 final rules and regulations, up from 2,400 the prior year. Every year, overregulation costs our economy $2 trillion dollars a year and reduces household wealth by almost $15,000 dollars.\n\nI've proposed a moratorium on new federal regulations that are not compelled by Congress or public safety, and I will eliminate all needless and job-killing regulations now on the books.\n\nThis includes eliminating some of our most intrusive regulations, like the Waters of The U.S. Rule. It also means scrapping the EPA's so-called Clean Power Plan which the government itself estimates will cost $7.2 billion a year. This Obama-Clinton directive will shut down most, if not all, coal-powered electricity plans in America. Remember what Hillary Clinton said? She wants to shut down the miners, just like she wants to shut down the steel mills.\n\nWe're going to put our great miners and steel workers back to work.\n\nEnergy reform is central to our plan as well\n\nAccording to the Heritage Foundation, by 2030, President Obama's energy restrictions will eliminate another half a million manufacturing jobs, reduce economic output by $2.5 trillion dollars, and reduce incomes by $7,000 dollars per person.\n\nHillary Clinton wants to go even further, and her plan could cost the economy $5 trillion dollars.\n\nA Trump Administration will lift restrictions on all sources of American energy production. According to the Institute for American Energy Resources this will:\n\nincrease GDP by more than $100 billion annually\n\nadd over 500,000 new jobs annually\n\nincrease annual wages by more than $30 billion over the next 7 years\n\nincrease federal, state, and local tax revenues by almost $6 trillion over 4 decades\n\nincrease total economic activity by more than $20 trillion over the next 40 years.\n\nIn addition, we will streamline the permitting process for all energy infrastructure projects, including the billions of dollars in projects held up by President Obama - creating countless more jobs in the process.\n\nFinally, comes trade - the foundation for everything\n\nAmerica's annual trade deficit with the world is now nearly $800 a billion a year - an enormous drag on growth.\n\nBetween World War II and the year 2000, the United States averaged a 3.5% growth rate. But, after China joined the World Trade Organization, our average growth rate has been reduced to only 2 percent.\n\nPredatory trade practices, product dumping, currency manipulation and intellectual property theft have taken millions of jobs and trillions in wealth from our country.\n\nIt is no great secret that many of the special interests funding my opponent's campaign are the same people profiting from these terrible trade deals. The same so-called experts advising Hillary Clinton are the same people who gave us NAFTA, China's entry into the World Trade Organization, the job-killing trade deal with South Korea, and now the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n\nThe verdict is in. All of the special interests that the media race to for comment have been proven wrong about every single deal they've promoted - every lie and every prediction has crashed upon the rocks of reality.\n\nOur manufacturing base has crumbled, communities have been hollowed out, wages have declined, and households are making less today than they were in the year 2000.\n\nI have proposed a detailed plan to reform our trade policies and bring vast new jobs and wealth to America. This includes the following steps:\n\nI'm going to direct the Secretary of Commerce to identify every violation of trade agreements a foreign country is currently using to harm our workers. I will use every tool under American and international law to end these abuses, and I will use our greatest business leaders and finest negotiators - and I know who you are, many of you are in the room.\n\nWe are going to start with NAFTA, which is causing so much damage to our country. We will entirely renegotiate NAFTA into a deal that will either be good for us or will be terminated until a brand new and productive deal can be signed.\n\nWe are also going to keep America out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n\nNext, I am going to instruct my Treasury Secretary to label China a currency manipulator, and to apply tariffs to any country that devalues its currency to gain an unfair advantage over the United States.\n\nI am going to instruct the U.S. Trade Representative to bring trade cases against China. China's unfair subsidy behavior is prohibited by the terms of its entrance to the WTO, and I intend to enforce those rules.\n\nIf China does not stop its illegal activities, including its theft of American trade secrets and intellectual property, I will apply countervailing duties until China ceases and desists.\n\nJust the single action of enforcing intellectual property rules alone would add millions of new American jobs. According to the U.S. International Trade Commission, improved protection of America's intellectual property in China would add 2 million jobs a year to the United States every single year.\n\nWe are going to stop the outflow of jobs from our country, and open a new highway of jobs back into our country.\n\nHere is how the plan adds up\n\nWe are proposing a $4.4 trillion tax cut that will score as $2.6 trillion under a dynamic growth model, which is how taxes should be scored. This includes the childcare plan.\n\nOur economic team has further modeled that the growth-induced savings from trade, energy and regulation reform will shave at least another $1.8 trillion off of the remaining cost.\n\nThat leaves around $800 billion dollars. This money can all be saved through simple, common sense reforms. If we save just one penny of each federal dollar spent on non-defense, and non-entitlement programs, we can save almost $1 trillion over the next decade - again this is spending that does not touch defense, and that does not touch entitlements.\n\nIf our plan exceeds the 3.5% ten-year growth average, then our jobs proposal will actually reduce the deficit. Savings will be compounded by the fact that people who are currently receiving unemployment or welfare will finally be able to find jobs.\n\nThis is the most pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-family plan put forth perhaps in the history of our country.\n\nThis is what our new future will look like\n\nI am going to lower you taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations, on business and in your life; I'm going to unleash American energy; I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare; I'm going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution; I'm going rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; I'm going to save your 2nd amendment; I'm going to stop illegal immigration and drugs coming into our country, and yes, we will build the wall ; and I'm going to renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, especially NAFTA - and we will only make great trade deals that put the American worker first.\n\nAnd we are going to put our miners and our steelworkers back to work.\n\nWe will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.\n\nAmerican cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.\n\nAmerican steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.\n\nAmerican hands will rebuild this nation - and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.\n\nWe will put new American metal into the spine of this country.\n\nJobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores.\n\nWe Will Make America Wealthy Again.\n\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\n\nAnd Will Make America Great Again.\n\nThank you, and God Bless!\u0000","44":"I am going to fight so hard for all of you, and I am going to bring back the jobs that have been stripped away from you and your country.\nIn 39 days, we are going to win the state of Michigan and we are going to win the White House.\n\nIt is going to be a victory for YOU, the American people.\n\nWe are going to take on the special interests, the lobbyists, and the powerful politicians that have stolen your jobs, your wealth, and your middle class.\n\nWe are going to take on the arrogant, corrupt corporate media that have enabled the global theft of American prosperity - a theft that has left behind crumbling schools, roads, bridges and a\n\ndepleted military.\n\nIt is time to rebuild Detroit. It is time to rebuild Michigan. It is time to rebuild the United States of America.\n\nHillary Clinton has made a living raking in donations from special interests that have ripped the jobs right out of Michigan. These are the people whose policies raided the jobs from Detroit. That's how she gets rich - by taking your jobs and your money away from you.\n\nThat's why Hillary Clinton, if she ever got the chance, would 100% approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The deal she called the \"Gold Standard.\" The TPP will economically devastate Michigan, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and so many other states across this country.\n\nHillary Clinton's donors want the TPP - and their wish is her command.\n\nThese special interests pay her for speeches. They pay her Foundation. They pay her husband. In return, they GET YOUR JOBS. Like I've been saying all week, when it comes to Hillary Clinton, all you have to do is remember these words: FOLLOW THE MONEY.\n\nHillary Clinton praised or pushed TPP on 45 separate occasions. Her close associate and confidant, Terry McAuliffe, said she'd pass it. Her husband has talked it up. Everyone knows she's for it, because she doesn't believe in protecting American Sovereignty.\n\nHillary Clinton only believes in protecting one thing: her donors.\n\nOf the 262 companies that lobbied for the passage of TPP, 82 or nearly 1 in 3 donated between $21 and $67 million to the Clinton Foundation.\n\n9 companies that lobbied for the passage of TPP paid Hillary Clinton $2.7 million for paid speeches.\n\nOf the 12 signatory countries that are parties to TPP, 3 gave between $6 and $15 million to the Clinton Foundation.\n\nAt least 4 lobbyists who are actively lobbying for TPP passage have raised more than $800,000 for her campaign.\n\nOn November 8th, We are going to end the Clinton Corruption and we are going to do something that has been a long, long time coming: WE ARE GOING TO PUT AMERICA FIRST.\n\nHillary Clinton is an insider fighting only for herself and for her donors.\n\nI am an outsider fighting for you.\n\nHillary Clinton is the one who rigged the system.\n\nWe are the ones who are going to change the system so it's fair and just for every American.\n\nWe have a movement. The corrupt establishment is panicking because they know how hard it is to stop us. The news anchors and the donors and the lobbyists who are used to getting their way are trying to do everything they can to help Hillary Clinton and to cling to their power and prestige.\n\nThe arrogant political class doesn't believe in protecting jobs and wages for Americans.\n\nThey don't believe in secure borders and strong walls.\n\nThese Washington and Wall Street insiders don't believe in hiring more police, producing more American energy, or giving school choice to poor children trapped in failing schools.\n\nFor decades, we've talked about the corruption, incompetence, and failures of our leaders. 2016 is our long-awaited chance to fix the problem - and to hold our politicians accountable. If you do this one simple thing, you can deliver justice for every single person who has been wronged by the system: show up and vote.\n\nWhen you cast that ballot, just picture a Wall Street boardroom filled with the special interests who have been bleeding this county dry, and imagine the look on their faces when you tell all of them: you're fired.\n\nIn their place, will be a new government. We are the Party of Abraham Lincoln, and once again, we will have a government of, by and for the people.\n\nWe are going to do it together. In 39 days, everything is going to change.\n\nNow, the media doesn't want to talk about Hillary Clinton and her corruption. So we are going to spell it out for them today.\n\nThe large corporations who support terrible trade deals that ship your jobs overseas - they are donating to Hillary Clinton.\n\nFollow the money.\n\nThe Wall Street investors who have rigged the regulations against the middle class - they are donating to Hillary Clinton.\n\nFollow the money.\n\nThe wealthy donors who want to shut down American energy - they are donating to Hillary Clinton.\n\nFollow the money.\n\nThe special interests who want open borders are donating to Hillary Clinton.\n\nFollow the money.\n\nIn her campaign for President, Hillary Clinton has received $100 million dollars in contributions from Wall Street and the hedge funds.\n\nShe and Bill were paid $150 million for speeches since Bill left the Oval Office.\n\nThe same groups paying Bill and Hillary for their speeches were lobbying the federal government.\n\nTwenty-two groups paying Bill Clinton for speeches lobbied the State Department while Hillary was Secretary of State.\n\nFavors and access were granted to those who wrote checks.\n\nShe put the office of Secretary of State up for sale - and if she ever got the chance, she'd put the Oval Office up for sale too.\n\nShe deleted and bleached 33,000 emails after a Congressional subpoena. 13 phones missing, several destroyed with a hammer. Her staffers taking the fifth amendment, and her ringleaders getting immunity deals. Foreign enemies with easy access to hack her server. Lies to Congress, under oath, about turning over her work-related emails.\n\nWe are going to call them the FBI Immunity Five. So here's my question for Hillary Clinton: can you promise that not one of the five people who were granted criminal immunity will ever be allowed to serve in a Clinton Administration?\n\nAnd here is the demand I am making today to President Obama: will you pledge, here and now, not to issue a pardon to Hillary Clinton and her co-conspirators for their many crimes against our country and society itself?\n\nNo one is above the law. Not even Hillary Clinton.\n\nClinton and her cronies will say anything, do anything, lie about anything to keep their grip on\n\npower - to keep their control over this country.\n\nRemember the Clinton pardon of fugitive Marc Rich, in exchange for unknown and undisclosed amounts of money?\n\nThe American people have had it with years, decades, of Clinton Corruption and scandals. They are tired of the lies, they are tired of the trivial politics, they are tired of being talked down to, looked down upon, and treated like second class citizens.\n\nThis will be the year the American people say: Enough is enough.\n\nHillary Clinton has been a disaster for so many communities, but especially for African-American communities. I don't think African-Americans are going to come out and vote for Clinton - they are too smart, and they know they are being used. They also know that she'll do nothing for them once the election is over - she never does, and that will never change. Many of them will never forget her calling young African-American men \"super-predators.\"\n\nTo the African-American community, let me ask you this question: are you better off than you were eight years ago? If not, vote for Donald Trump. I will bring jobs, great education, and safe neighborhoods.\n\nIf you keep voting for the same people, you will keep getting the same results.\n\nLook at what the Democrats have done to Detroit. Half of Detroit residents do not work. Nearly 40% of the city lives in poverty. It's the second most dangerous city in America, according to the FBI.\n\nThis is the legacy of the policies embraced by Hillary Clinton.\n\nA Trump Administration will bring prosperity to all of our people.\n\nMy economic agenda can be summed up with three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs.\n\nWe are going to pass the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan.\n\nEvery wasteful and unnecessary regulation will be eliminated.\n\nWe will unleash the power of American energy.\n\nThe catastrophe known as Obamacare will be repealed and replaced.\n\nAnd the disastrous trade deals, like NAFTA, that have caused so much pain in Michigan, will be renegotiated - and we will bring back your auto-manufacturing.\n\nMichigan has lost more than 1 in 3 of its manufacturing jobs since the twin disasters of NAFTA and China's entrance into the WTO - both deals pushed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton.\n\nBefore NAFTA went into effect, there were 280,000 auto workers in Michigan. Today, that number is only 160,000.\n\nFord is moving its small car production to Mexico.\n\nIt used to be that the cars were made in Flint and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico. Today, the cars are made in Mexico and you can't drink the water in Flint.\n\nHillary Clinton also gave us the job-killing trade deal with South Korea, which has cost this country another 100,000 jobs.\n\nHillary opposed the Korea deal when she was running for President in 2007. She campaigned right here in Michigan and said the Korea deal \"will hurt the us auto industry, increase our trade deficit, cost us good middle-class jobs and make America less competitive.\" She pledged to reject the deal.\n\nBut she lied to all of you, just like she lied about her emails.\n\nOnce installed as Secretary of State, she supported it and called it a \"cutting-edge deal.\" She rammed it through to adoption - she always does whatever the donors tell her to do, no matter how it impacts our families, schools and communities.\n\nThe U.S. trade deficit with Korea in the top ten products that Michigan exports to Korea grew 54 percent as exports fell and imports rose. This is what Hillary Clinton did to your state.\n\nAccording to the Economic Policy Institute, Michigan ranks first for jobs lost as a share of workforce due to the trade deficit with TPP members, and the country lost 740,000 manufacturing jobs as a result of that deficit last year. Just imagine how many more automobile jobs will be lost if the TPP is actually approved, as Hillary Clinton is planning to do.\n\nHillary Clinton is merely a vessel for the special interests trying to strip this country of its wealth, its jobs, and its status as a sovereign nation.\n\nShe even supports the disastrous surrender of America's control of the internet, which is happening tomorrow. Hillary Clinton's website says she supports the decision to give away the internet to a \"global community of stakeholders.\"\n\nSomeone needs to inform Hillary Clinton it's not the job of our leaders to represent a \"global community.\" It's the job of our leaders to represent American citizens. Losing control of the internet to other foreign entities is just one more way Obama-Clinton have sold out the citizens of this country.\n\nHillary Clinton is a globalist who will never protect the freedom and jobs of the American people.\n\nI am not running to be President of the World. I am running to be President of the United States of America.\n\nHave you ever wondered why it is that all the things that the American people want never seem to happen?\n\nThe reason for this is simple. It's because the financial interests who control our politics and our media don't want these changes to happen.\n\nHillary Clinton has been there for 30 years, and has never done anything for you and your\n\nfamily.\n\nJust look at how badly she messed up on the Iran deal. And, just today, we learned that on the same day as the hostages were released, the United States signed an agreement lifting sanctions on two Iranian banks involved in financing Iran's missile programs.\n\nHillary Clinton is there for only one reason, to protect her donors and collect their money.\n\nOur campaign is taking on big business, big media and big donors - we're taking them on for YOU. So you can have the future you want.\n\nOur campaign is about breaking-up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We're trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives.\n\nThey're all part of the same corrupt political establishment. And they nod along when Hillary Clinton slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable.\n\nI call you hardworking American Patriots and together we are going to save this country.\n\nTogether, we can accomplish anything we want.\n\nBut that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th.\n\nYou have 39 days until the election. You have 39 days to make every dream you ever dreamed\n\nfor your country come true.\n\nDo Not Let This Chance Slip Away.\n\nYou have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this nation.\n\nThe arrogance of Washington, D.C. will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the\n\nAmerican voter.\n\nOn November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is Back - Bigger and Better and Stronger than ever before.\n\nHere are just some of the great things that will happen for your country:\n\nWe are going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; make childcare more affordable; bring our manufacturing jobs back to Michigan; end illegal immigration; keep Radical Islamic terrorists out of our country; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\n\nWe will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.\n\nAmerican cars - made in Michigan - will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.\n\nAmerican steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.\n\nAmerican hands will rebuild this nation - and American energy, mined from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.\n\nWe will put new American steel into the spine of this country.\n\nI will fight for every neglected part of this nation - and I will fight to bring us all together as Americans.\n\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\n\nTo the people of Michigan, I promise you this -\n\nWe will make America wealthy again.\n\nWe will make America strong again.\n\nWe will make America safe again.\n\nAnd we will make America great again.\n\nThank you, and God Bless!\u0000","45":"It is a privilege to be here this morning with so many distinguished members of our armed services.\nBefore we get started with our Q & A, I'd like to address one of the most important aspects of America's national security, and that's Cyber Security.\n\nTo truly make America safe, we must make cybersecurity a major priority for both the government and the private sector.\n\nCyber theft is the fastest growing crime in the United States.\n\nAs President, improving cyber security will be an immediate and top priority for my Administration.\n\nOne of the very first things I will do is to order a thorough review of our cyber defenses and weaknesses, including all vital infrastructure.\n\nCyber-attacks from foreign governments, especially China, Russia, and North Korea along with non-state terrorist actors and organized criminal groups, constitute one of our most critical national security concerns.\n\nHillary Clinton's only experience in cyber security involves her criminal scheme to violate federal law, engineering a massive cover-up, and putting the entire nation in harm's way. The fact that a former Senator and Secretary of State claimed not to know what the letter \"C\" means is just one more example of why she's unfit to hold public office.\n\nThe scope of our cyber security problem is enormous. Our government, our businesses, our trade secrets, and our citizens' most sensitive information are all facing constant cyber attacks.\n\nJust consider some of these recent hacks:\n\nJP Morgan Chase had 73 million emails stolen.\n\nE-Bay was invaded and gave up 150 million passwords.\n\nTarget was attacked and gave up 40 million credit card numbers.\n\nAttacks like these are happening on a regular basis both in the United States and around the world, and the costs in our privacy, our security and on our financial sector are extraordinary.\n\nIdentify theft, financial laundering, as well as ransom ware - involving the extortion of a hacked institution - are all becoming increasingly common.\n\nIncredibly, hackers were able to obtain at least 20 million identities of people who underwent FBI background investigations.\n\nThe information hacked contains facts discovered by the FBI in doing background checks for people seeking positions with the Federal Government. It is a treasure trove which can be easily used for blackmail.\n\nThe fact that this highly classified information was so poorly protected demonstrates that cyber security is just one more area where the Obama Administration has failed.\n\nWe should not let this be like the history of the Mafia which was allowed to grow into a nation-wide organization which infiltrated and corrupted so many areas of society for such a long time.\n\nWe can learn from this history that when the Department of Justice, the FBI, the DEA and state and local police and prosecutors were combined in Task Forces directed at the Mafia, they were able to have great success in prosecuting them, seizing their business interests and removing their infiltration from legitimate areas of society.\n\nAs President, I will instruct the Department of Justice to create Joint Task Forces throughout the United States to work together with Federal, State, and local law enforcement authorities and international law enforcement to crush this still-developing area of crime.\n\nI will make certain that our military is the best in the world in both cyber offense and defense. I will also ask my Secretary of Defense and Joint Chiefs to present recommendations for strengthening and augmenting our Cyber Command.\n\nAs a deterrent against attacks on our critical resources, the United States must possess the unquestioned capacity to launch crippling cyber counter-attacks. This is the warfare of the future, America's dominance in this arena must be unquestioned.\n\nCyber security is not only a question of developing defensive technologies but offensive technologies as well.\n\nFor non-state terror actors, the United States must develop the ability - no matter how difficult - to track down and incapacitate those responsible. We should turn cyber warfare into one of our greatest weapons against the terrorists.\n\nTo enhance the defense of the other agencies of government, including our law enforcement agencies, we will put together a team of the best military, civilian and private sector cyber security experts to comprehensively review all of our cyber security systems and technology.\n\nThe Cyber Review Team will proceed with the most sensitive systems first, but ultimately all systems will be analyzed and made as secure as modern technology permits.\n\nI will also require that follow-up reviews take place on a regular basis determined by the sensitive nature of the security involved.\n\nThe review will include providing exact recommendations for the best combination of defensive technologies tailored to specific agencies.\n\nThis will include the various methods of internal monitoring, attack and penetration, investigation of suspected hackers or rogue employees, and identity protection for government employees.\n\nThe review team will also remain current on the constantly-evolving new methods of attack, and will attempt to anticipate them and develop defenses as often as possible before major breaches occur.\n\nThis group of experts will set up protocols for each agency and government officials, requiring them to follow best practices.\n\nThey will also establish a training program for all government employees to make certain they understand what defenses are available and utilize them, along with a continuing education program so everyone is aware of the newest methods of both attack and defense.\n\nThose who violate classification rules will be held responsible to the fullest extent of the law. I will appoint an Attorney General who will reform the Department of Justice like it was necessary after Watergate. My Attorney General will restore the integrity of the Department of Justice.\n\nToday is just the beginning of a long and overdue national discussion of how to protect ourselves from modern cyber-crime and evolving national security threats, and how to develop the cyber offense strategies necessary to gain a critical security edge in the 21st century.\u0000","46":"Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you.\nToday, I'm going to outline a plan for American economic revival - it is a bold, ambitious, forward-looking plan to massively increase jobs, wages, incomes and opportunities for the people of our country.\n\nMy plan will embrace the truth that people flourish under a minimum government burden, and it will tap into the incredible unrealized potential of our workers and their dreams.\n\nRight now, 92 million Americans are on the sidelines, outside the workforce, and not part of our economy. It's a silent nation of jobless Americans.\n\nLook no further than the city of Flint, where I just visited. The jobs have stripped from this community, and its infrastructure has collapsed. In 1970, there were more than 80,000 people in Flint working for GM - today it is less than 8,000. Now Ford has announced it is moving all small car production to Mexico.\n\nIt used to be cars were made in Flint and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico. Now, the cars are made in Mexico and you can't drink the water in Flint.\n\nWe are going to turn this around.\n\nMy economic plan rejects the cynicism that says our labor force will keep declining, that our jobs will keep leaving, and that our economy can never grow as it did once before.\n\nWe reject the pessimism that says our standard of living can no longer rise, and that all that's left to do is divide up and redistribute our shrinking resources.\n\nEverything that is broken today can be fixed, and every failure can be turned into a great success.\n\nJobs can stop leaving our country, and start pouring in. Failing schools can become flourishing schools. Crumbling roads and bridges can become gleaming new infrastructure. Inner cities can experience a flood of new jobs and investment. And rising crime can give way to safe and prosperous communities.\n\nAll of these things, and so much more, are possible. But to accomplish them, we must replace the present policy of globalism - which has moved so many jobs and so much wealth out of our country - and replace it with a new policy of Americanism.\n\nUnder this American System, every policy decision we make must pass a simple test: does it create more jobs and better wages for Americans?\n\nIf we lower our taxes, remove destructive regulations, unleash the vast treasure of American energy, and negotiate trade deals that put America First, then there is no limit to the number of jobs we can create and the amount of prosperity we can unleash.\n\nAmerica will truly be the greatest place in the world to invest, hire, grow and to create new jobs, new technologies, and entire new industries.\n\nInstead of driving jobs and wealth away, America will become the world's great magnet for innovation and job creation.\n\nMy opponent's plan rejects this optimism. She offers only more taxing, regulating, more spending and more wealth redistribution - a future of slow growth, declining incomes, and dwindling prosperity.\n\nThe only people who get rich under Hillary Clinton's scheme are the donors and the special interests.\n\nIn Hillary Clinton's America, we have surrendered our status as the world's great economy, and we have surrendered our middle class to the whims of foreign countries.\n\nNot one single idea she has will create one net American job, or create one new dollar of American wealth for our workers. The only thing she can ever offer is a welfare check. Our plan will produce paychecks, and they're going to be great paychecks for millions of people now unemployed.\n\nIn the course of this campaign, I have travelled all across this country and I've met the most amazing people. Every day, I've seen the goodness and character of our country, and brave citizens proudly fighting through hard times and difficult circumstances.\n\nIn many parts of our country, the hard times never seem to end. I've visited cities and towns in upstate New York where half the jobs have left and moved to other countries.\n\nPoliticians have abandoned these places all over our country and the people who live there.\n\nWorse still, politicians have heaped scorn and disdain on these wonderful Americans. My opponent described tens of millions of American citizens as deplorable and irredeemable - how can Hillary Clinton seek to lead this country when she considers its citizens beyond redemption?\n\nThe hardworking people she calls deplorable are the most admirable people I know: they are cops and soldiers, teachers and firefighters, young and old, moms and dads, blacks, whites and Latinos - but above everything else, they are all American. They love their families, they love their country, and they want a better future.\n\nThese are the forgotten men and women of America. People who work hard but don't have a voice.\n\nI am running to be their voice, and to fight to bring prosperity to every part of this country.\n\nToo many of our leaders have forgotten that it's their duty to protect the jobs, wages and well-being of American workers before any other consideration.\n\nI'm not running to be President of the world. I'm running to be President of the United States - and as your President, I will fight for every last American job.\n\nWe are the nation that tamed the West, dug out the Panama Canal, won two World Wars, and put a man on the moon.\n\nIt's time to start thinking big once again.\n\nThat's why I believe it is time to establish a national goal of reaching 4% economic growth.\n\nIn working with my economic team, we've put together a plan that puts us on track to achieve that goal. Over the next ten years, our economic team estimates that under our plan the economy will average 3.5% growth and create a total of 25 million new jobs. You can visit our website to see the math.\n\nThis growth means that our jobs plan, including our childcare reforms, will be completely paid-for in combination with proposed budget savings.\n\nIt will be deficit neutral. If we reach 4% growth, it will reduce the deficit.\n\nIt will be accomplished through a complete overhaul of our tax, regulatory, energy and trade policies.\n\nRight now, under Obama-Clinton policies, the economy grew only 1.1 percent last quarter - that translates to millions of lost jobs.\n\nThis is the weakest so-called recovery since the Great Depression.\n\nOver the last 7 years, the economy grew only 2.1 percent, the slowest period in seventy years. Had the economy grown under Obama at the same rate as Reagan, it would have meant 10 million more jobs.\n\nPerhaps most shockingly, 1 in 6 men aged 18-34 are either in jail or out of work.\n\nMeanwhile, another 2 million Hispanic-Americans have been added to the ranks of those in poverty.\n\nOn top of it all, the Obama-Clinton policies have doubled the national debt. It took more than 230 years for the United States to accumulate it's first $10 trillion dollars in debt - it took President Obama only eight years to add another $10 trillion.\n\nNow, it would be one thing if that money had been used to completely rebuild our nation, our military, and our infrastructure.\n\nInstead, the opposite happened. We doubled our debt and, in return, we have dilapidated infrastructure, failing schools, a badly depleted military, and another 14 million people who have left the workforce.\n\nNever has so much money been spent so poorly.\n\nBut we're going to turn that all around. Here's how.\n\nIt begins with bold new tax reform.\n\nAs outlined in Detroit, our tax plan will greatly simplify the code and reduce the number of brackets from 7 to 3. The 3 new brackets will be 12, 25 and 33, but low-income Americans will pay no income tax at all - in fact, our plan will remove millions and millions of workers from the income tax rolls entirely.\n\nBy lowering rates, streamlining deductions, and simplifying the process, we will add millions of new jobs.\n\nIn addition, because we have strongly capped deductions for the wealthy and closed special interest loopholes, the tax relief will be concentrated on the working and middle class taxpayer. They will receive the biggest benefit - it won't even be close.\n\nThis is a working and middle class tax relief proposal.\n\nThe tax relief for these workers will be expanded by my childcare proposals that I have worked on with my daughter, Ivanka.\n\nThese proposals are a central element of our comprehensive tax reform and economic growth plan.\n\nFamilies will be able to fully deduct the average cost of childcare from their taxes, including stay-at-home parents. Because this deduction is capped, it will disproportionately benefit working and middle class families. The less you make, the larger a share of your income you can exclude from taxation.\n\nParents will also be able to enroll in tax-free dependent care savings accounts for their children or elderly relatives. Low-income households will benefit from both an Expanded Earned Income Tax Credit - in the form a Childcare rebate - and a matching $500 contribution for their savings accounts.\n\nA married couple earning $50,000 per year with two children and $8,000 in child care expenses will save 35% from their current tax bill.\n\nA married couple earning $75,000 per year with two children and $10,000 in child care expenses will receive a 30% reduction in their tax bill.\n\nBy contrast, someone earning $5 million will receive virtually no change in their tax bill at all.\n\nOne of our greatest job creation measures is going to be our 15% business tax rate - down from the current 35% rate, a reduction of more than 40 percent. An explosion of new business and new jobs will be created. It will be amazing to watch.\n\nWe will also allow U.S.-based manufacturers to fully expense the cost of new plants and equipment.\n\nOn top of that, we will bring back trillions in business wealth parked overseas and tax it at a 10% rate. Some people say there are $2 trillion dollars overseas, I think it's $5 trillion. By taxing it at 10% instead of 35%, all of this money will come back into our country.\n\nWe will turn America into a magnet for new jobs - and that means jobs in our poorest communities.\n\nNext, comes regulations.\n\nOne of the keys to unlocking growth is scaling-back years of disastrous regulations unilaterally imposed by our out-of-control bureaucracy.\n\nRegulations have grown into a massive, job-killing industry - and the regulation industry is one business I will put an end to.\n\nIn 2015 alone, federal agencies issued over 3,300 final rules and regulations, up from 2,400 the prior year. Every year, overregulation costs our economy $2 trillion dollars a year and reduces household wealth by almost $15,000 dollars.\n\nI've proposed a moratorium on new federal regulations that are not compelled by Congress or public safety, and I will eliminate all needless and job-killing regulations now on the books.\n\nThis includes eliminating some of our most intrusive regulations, like the Waters of The U.S. Rule. It also means scrapping the EPA's so-called Clean Power Plan which the government itself estimates will cost $7.2 billion a year. This Obama-Clinton directive will shut down most, if not all, coal-powered electricity plans in America. Remember what Hillary Clinton said? She wants to shut down the miners, just like she wants to shut down the steel mills.\n\nWe're going to put our great miners and steel workers back to work.\n\nEnergy reform is central to our plan as well\n\nAccording to the Heritage Foundation, by 2030, President Obama's energy restrictions will eliminate another half a million manufacturing jobs, reduce economic output by $2.5 trillion dollars, and reduce incomes by $7,000 dollars per person.\n\nHillary Clinton wants to go even further, and her plan could cost the economy $5 trillion dollars.\n\nA Trump Administration will lift restrictions on all sources of American energy production. According to the Institute for American Energy Resources this will:\n\nincrease GDP by more than $100 billion annually\n\nadd over 500,000 new jobs annually\n\nincrease annual wages by more than $30 billion over the next 7 years\n\nincrease federal, state, and local tax revenues by almost $6 trillion over 4 decades\n\nincrease total economic activity by more than $20 trillion over the next 40 years.\n\nIn addition, we will streamline the permitting process for all energy infrastructure projects, including the billions of dollars in projects held up by President Obama - creating countless more jobs in the process.\n\nFinally, comes trade - the foundation for everything\n\nAmerica's annual trade deficit with the world is now nearly $800 a billion a year - an enormous drag on growth.\n\nBetween World War II and the year 2000, the United States averaged a 3.5% growth rate. But, after China joined the World Trade Organization, our average growth rate has been reduced to only 2 percent.\n\nPredatory trade practices, product dumping, currency manipulation and intellectual property theft have taken millions of jobs and trillions in wealth from our country.\n\nIt is no great secret that many of the special interests funding my opponent's campaign are the same people profiting from these terrible trade deals. The same so-called experts advising Hillary Clinton are the same people who gave us NAFTA, China's entry into the World Trade Organization, the job-killing trade deal with South Korea, and now the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n\nThe verdict is in. All of the special interests that the media race to for comment have been proven wrong about every single deal they've promoted - every lie and every prediction has crashed upon the rocks of reality.\n\nOur manufacturing base has crumbled, communities have been hollowed out, wages have declined, and households are making less today than they were in the year 2000.\n\nI have proposed a detailed plan to reform our trade policies and bring vast new jobs and wealth to America. This includes the following steps:\n\nI'm going to direct the Secretary of Commerce to identify every violation of trade agreements a foreign country is currently using to harm our workers. I will use every tool under American and international law to end these abuses, and I will use our greatest business leaders and finest negotiators - and I know who you are, many of you are in the room.\n\nWe are going to start with NAFTA, which is causing so much damage to our country. We will entirely renegotiate NAFTA into a deal that will either be good for us or will be terminated until a brand new and productive deal can be signed.\n\nWe are also going to keep America out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n\nNext, I am going to instruct my Treasury Secretary to label China a currency manipulator, and to apply tariffs to any country that devalues its currency to gain an unfair advantage over the United States.\n\nI am going to instruct the U.S. Trade Representative to bring trade cases against China. China's unfair subsidy behavior is prohibited by the terms of its entrance to the WTO, and I intend to enforce those rules.\n\nIf China does not stop its illegal activities, including its theft of American trade secrets and intellectual property, I will apply countervailing duties until China ceases and desists.\n\nJust the single action of enforcing intellectual property rules alone would add millions of new American jobs. According to the U.S. International Trade Commission, improved protection of America's intellectual property in China would add 2 million jobs a year to the United States every single year.\n\nWe are going to stop the outflow of jobs from our country, and open a new highway of jobs back into our country.\n\nHere is how the plan adds up\n\nWe are proposing a $4.4 trillion tax cut that will score as $2.6 trillion under a dynamic growth model, which is how taxes should be scored. This includes the childcare plan.\n\nOur economic team has further modeled that the growth-induced savings from trade, energy and regulation reform will shave at least another $1.8 trillion off of the remaining cost.\n\nThat leaves around $800 billion dollars. This money can all be saved through simple, common sense reforms. If we save just one penny of each federal dollar spent on non-defense, and non-entitlement programs, we can save almost $1 trillion over the next decade - again this is spending that does not touch defense, and that does not touch entitlements.\n\nIf our plan exceeds the 3.5% ten-year growth average, then our jobs proposal will actually reduce the deficit. Savings will be compounded by the fact that people who are currently receiving unemployment or welfare will finally be able to find jobs.\n\nThis is the most pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-family plan put forth perhaps in the history of our country.\n\nThis is what our new future will look like\n\nI am going to lower you taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations, on business and in your life; I'm going to unleash American energy; I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare; I'm going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution; I'm going rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; I'm going to save your 2nd amendment; I'm going to stop illegal immigration and drugs coming into our country, and yes, we will build the wall ; and I'm going to renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, especially NAFTA - and we will only make great trade deals that put the American worker first.\n\nAnd we are going to put our miners and our steelworkers back to work.\n\nWe will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.\n\nAmerican cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.\n\nAmerican steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.\n\nAmerican hands will rebuild this nation - and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.\n\nWe will put new American metal into the spine of this country.\n\nJobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores.\n\nWe Will Make America Wealthy Again.\n\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\n\nAnd Will Make America Great Again.\n\nThank you, and God Bless!\u0000","47":"Thank you! Thank you all so much. Wow! I am so happy to be back here in Iowa on a beautiful fall day to see all of you. And I especially want to thank Janelle for her intro-duction. And I so appreciate that Janelle and Nora and her husband Stu are here today. I remember so well when I met her back in 2015, and I saw that sign. And my best friend from sixth grade was also going through breast cancer and being treated. And when I saw Janelle's sign, it just made me think about my friend, and I wanted to go over and meet this woman who had been through 13 chemo treatments already. And we just clicked. And I have been so grateful to be able to get to know her better and spend time with her when I see her. And I got to introduce her to my best friend when my best friend came to Iowa. So the circle is completed, and more people are reaching out and finding ways to help each other.\nNow, before I came out, I had the great, great privilege of saying hello to someone, Ruline Steininger, who is - is Ruline still here? I know she was going to try to stay. There she is. Hello, Ruline! Hello, Ruline! Ruline is a 103-year-old resident of Pleasant Hill who was born in 1913. I am so grateful for her support, and I don't know if any of you have seen the videos, both about Janelle and about Ruline. But I really do recommend that you see them both. Ruline talks about this long, active life that she's had and everything she has seen happen in America and the world. And I think it's important to have that perspective. So it's a great honor to have Ruline supporting me. I am so pleased. And she's going to go vote early today to make sure her vote counts.\n\nI want to thank Dr. Andy McGuire for chairing the Iowa Democratic Party, fighting so hard to elect Democrats. And I want to lift up and thank our Democratic Senate candidate, Patty Judge. Where's Patty? Patty's out there fighting hard every single day, and she can use your help to make a strong case for her to go to the Senate. And Jim Mowrer, the 3rd District congressional candidate. Jim is running a great campaign, and we are really looking forward to having him in Washington. But that really depends upon everybody here and everybody across the great state of Iowa.\n\nNow, while we're meeting on this beautiful day here in Des Moines, I know our friends in Cedar Rapids and the region are once again facing the potential of flooding. I talked with the mayor. I talked with city council members and other leaders over the last day or so. They hope that they will not have the flooding. They took a lot of good precautionary measures. Our campaign, along with thousands of people, came out and helped to put the sandbags in to try to prevent flooding. And I told them that if I'm so fortunate enough as to be president, we're going to have a big infrastructure program, and we're going to help prevent flooding in places like Cedar Rapids.\n\nNow, I also just want to say on a personal note I was terribly upset this morning to learn about a train crash in New Jersey. That's very personal to me. I live in New York. People commute into New York from New Jersey. We had about a hundred commuters injured and one died. I just want to send our thoughts and prayers to them because it's a horrible accident that ran into the depot and caused all kinds of damage. So I want to lift up the people of New Jersey and New York today.\n\nNow, we are starting to vote in Iowa today! And I saw my good friend Ruth Harkin, and she told me she was the first person in line to vote today. And we have, what, 40 days, 39 days, left. And each and every one of you have the chance to make sure that we keep our country on the right path. We have 40 days to win an election that's going to affect the next 40 years of our country. And you, every one of you, can make the difference in this election.\n\nNow, how many of you participated in the caucuses? Well, we've got a bunch of active Iowans here. Are you ready to go to the polls? Well, luckily, in Iowa you can start today. Lots of folks don't have that opportunity across the country. And a lot of our campaign volunteers are going to direct people right from this rally to early voting sites. We've got one right down the street. So when you finish here, you can go vote. And we can be on the path to victory here in Iowa.\n\nAny of you see that debate on Monday night? Well, one down, two to go. Well, I have to tell you, it was an extraordinary experience because I did get to say a few things about the positive agenda that we want to have for our country because I want this election to be about something, not just against somebody. And so I am going to close this campaign the way I started decades ago, fighting for kids and families because it's been the cause of my life. It will be the mission of my presidency because I know from my own experience that strong families are the base of a strong America. And I know from personal experience how important it is to give people the tools they need to make sure that they can go as far as their hard work, their talent, will take them.\n\nNow, you may have heard me say this. I started talking about this way back in the be-ginning of the campaign here in Iowa. But I was very fortunate. None of us picks our parents. But I really was fortunate. My dad was a Navy veteran, a small businessman, and he worked hard every single day to build a good life to provide financial security, a good, solid, middle class life. And I know how hard he worked because occasionally I'd go down to his print plant where he printed fabrics for draperies. And it was not a very big building. It didn't have any natural life. There were no windows in it. It's what he could afford.\n\nAnd there were two long tables. And he'd roll out the fabric, and then he would take a silkscreen. Any of you ever seen a silkscreen, an old-fashioned silkscreen? Not far from here there's a wonderful t-shirt store. Right? And they still use silkscreens for some of their printing. So he would take that silkscreen, and he'd put it down, and he would pour the paint in. Then he'd take a squeegee and he'd go across it. And then he'd lift it up, and he'd go all the way down the table. And if there was going to be more than one color, he'd do it all over again. And then when he finished, he would gather it up and put it in his car and he'd go deliver it to the customer who had ordered it.\n\nThat's how I was raised to think about doing business. You do your best. You enter into a contract or an agreement. Somebody orders your goods or your services. And then they pay you for it. Right? And as I said the other night, one of the things that we have found out is that as his own campaign manager said about him, Donald Trump has built a lot of businesses on the backs of the little guy. Her words. And I have met people who have been the victims of his refusal to honor contracts, to pay what had been bargained for. I just am grateful that my dad never did business with him or somebody like him because we couldn't have survived all that.\n\nAll that work, and then to be told we're not going to pay you, or maybe we'll pay you 10 cents on the dollar, or 20 cents? That's just wrong. What kind of person does that, takes advantage of dishwashers and painters and architects and glass installers and so many people? We've been looking into the records, and there's a long list of people who have been mistreated. I just don't believe that's the way we're supposed to treat each other in America. And that sure is not the way our president should be treating our citizens in our country.\n\nNow, my mom had a very different story. My dad's father was a factory worker, but they had a strong family. My mom was abandoned by her parents and then sent to live with grandparents, and they didn't want her. So she was out on her own by the age of 14. She was working as a housemaid and a babysitter. And it may sound harsh, but I will quickly tell you that it was the first time in her young life that she ever was in a family that showed love and respect for each other. So for her, it was a gift.\n\nAnd then she got another gift. The woman she worked for knew that my mom wanted to go to high school. And so the woman said, 'If you can get up really early and you can get your chores done and get the little kids off to school, you can go to high school. But you'll have to come right back.' That may sound harsh for a 14-year-old, but for my mother it made all the difference. And that's exactly what she did for four years, and most days she had to run - run - to get there. But she didn't care because she wanted to get an education.\n\nSo when I learned more about my mom's life, I knew that what I wanted to do was to stand up for kids and families, and especially for kids who've been left out or left behind in some way. That's why I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund and learned quickly that kids with disabilities were not in our public schools back then, and we worked to put together a coalition and convince Congress to pass the law, and boy, every day I am so thankful for your former Senator Tom Harkin, who made the rights and opportunities of people with disabilities the centerpiece of his distinguished career.\n\nSo that's been my mission: How are we going to do more to help kids and families? And so when I talk about the economy - because I think we have three big issues facing us. Number one, we need an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top, right? We need to keep our country safe and we need to lead the world with strong and steady leadership, in accordance with our values. And we need to bring our country together. We have to heal these divides.\n\nBut when I think about the economy, yes, I want more new, good jobs with rising in-comes. I see my friends from the laborers here. We need to do work that builds our roads, our bridges, our ports, our airports, our tunnels, our water systems, our sewer systems. This is good, honorable work, and boy, do we have a lot of it in America. We are living off the investments that our parents and our grandparents - and sometimes even great-grandparents - made. If we're going to have a competitive economy, we need to be building America again. And we also need to do more advanced manufacturing. And some of the most exciting developments I saw throughout this whole campaign were right here in Iowa. I saw in your community colleges some of the most advanced training that I've seen anywhere in the country. And I met young men and women who were getting credentialed to be able to leave high school to get good jobs as machinists and tool and die makers, and as designers using 3-D printing. I was so impressed. And I think we need to do that across America. And we need to bring technical education back to our high schools. It was a mistake when we took vocational education out of our high schools.\n\nAnother way that Iowa has influenced and inspired me is what you've done with clean renewable energy. Now, it wasn't a partisan issue in Iowa. It really got a big boost from your wonderful former governor, Tom Vilsack. But it's been continued over the years. And look at the results. Look how much energy you are getting here in Iowa from clean renewable sources, most particularly wind. Right? And look at the number of jobs - it's nearly 10,000 jobs now that are related to that. Plus the renewable fuel standard, which has motivated people to be creative about using biological material and experimenting with cellulosic material. I was in the forefront of moving toward a clean renewable energy future, and I'm excited by that.\n\nI'm running against someone who thinks climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. I know it's real. I believe in science. But I'll tell you what else is real. What's real are the economic opportunities, the new jobs and businesses we're going to create by assuming the responsibility to combat climate change, and the young people of our country are going to lead the way to doing that. Now, we also need to help small businesses. Iowa is filled with small businesses. It should be easier to start one, it shouldn't be so cumbersome to deal with all the multitude of regulations. We're going to try to streamline that process. Being the daughter of a small businessperson, I believe in giving people the chance to have their destinies in their own hands. And we're going to work hard. I want to be a first-class small business president, in honor of my dad, and I'm going to do everything I can to help you get started, and grow small businesses.\n\nBut while we're growing the economy, we need to make it fairer. And here are a couple of things I want to do. Let's raise the national minimum wage, so people who work full-time are not still in poverty. I've met - you know, two thirds of the people on minimum wage are women - and I've met a lot of minimum-wage workers right here in Iowa and across America. Sometimes they have to take two minimum-wage jobs, because a full-time minimum wage job will earn you $15,000 at the end of a full-time year of work. We also could give the biggest boost to incomes, and particularly family incomes, if we finally guaranteed equal pay for women's work.\n\nAnd the other thing I want to do is make sure more companies adopt profit-sharing, so if you helped to create the profits, all of you, not just the top executives, will be able to share in those profits. You know, at the debate the other night, one of my well-known supporters, Mark Cuban, was there in the front row. And he really, I think, unsettled my opponent. But I'll tell you, Mark Cuban's a real billionaire who actually uses profit-sharing, and not only while the business is ongoing, but one thing I really appreciate: first business he sold, he shared the profits with all of his employees. 300 employees became millionaires, because they had a boss who rewarded them for the hard work they did to make it a successful company, all together.\n\nAnd the final point I want to make about this is about family economics. You know, let's tackle the cost of childcare. Between 2000 and 2012, childcare costs went up 25 percent. Incomes barely budged, right? So we're going to increase federal investment, and provide more tax relief to working families, so no parent has to pay more than 10 percent of their income for quality childcare. Now, if you don't have small children or grandchildren right now, you might not realize the cost of childcare in a lot of states is more expensive than tuition at public colleges and universities. A lot of families are just so stressed out.\n\nThe other thing I want to do is to finally have our country join the rest of the advanced economies, and provide paid family leave, so you can take care of your family members. Now, a lot of people think this is primarily about newborn babies, adopted babies, and of course that's a big part of it. Last year, in Newton, a mom said to me, I'm counting on you to know what it's like trying to take care of a newborn and having to go right back to work. Right?\n\nThat's a lot of you. There you are. Okay. And I've got to tell you, I hear that all over. When my granddaughter was born and I was in the hospital with my daughter, I was talking to one of the nurses, and I said, so what is your biggest worry? She said, well, my biggest worry is that so many of these new moms have to go right back to work. Right back to work. But it's not just for babies. It's for sick children, sick spouses, elderly members of your family who are having health problems. There is nothing more important than caring for each other. And I will tell you, it is wrong to make it so difficult for American families.\n\nThe other big expense for family economics is education. Every one of our children deserve good teachers and good schools, no matter what zip code they live in, right? And we also have to make college affordable. Yesterday in New Hampshire, I was with my friend and my former opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders. I am very proud of the campaign that Bernie and I ran. It was a campaign about issues, not insults. And we shared a lot of the same goals, even though we have different ways of getting there. And so after it was over, he and I sat down and we began to hammer out some ideas about what we could do together. And one of them was to make college tuition free for any family whose income is $125,000 or less. And to make it debt-free for everybody else, so that you only pay what you can afford to pay, without going into debt.\n\nNow, right now, Iowans hold more than $12 billion in outstanding federal student loans. An education should give you a boost, not hold you back. And we're going to offer relief to those of you who already have debt. We have 40 million people who already have student debt in America, 300,000 of them right here in Iowa. We're going to help you refinance. It is outrageous that you can get a home mortgage at 3 percent, a car payment at 2 percent, and I met people in Iowa who were paying 8, 10, 12 percent interest on their student loans. I'll tell you what. I am not going to let the federal government make a profit off of lending money to young people to get their educations.\n\nAnd college is crucial, but this is not said often enough. Four-year college is not, and should not, be the only path to a good job that supports a middle-class life. So we're going to have real apprenticeships, not the kind where you're told, 'you're fired,' but the kind where you're told, 'you're hired.' We're going to help more people in high school and community college on the job learn a skill.\n\nSo I'm excited about what we can do together. I know so much of this campaign has been about, you know, whatever my opponent says, and who he attacks, and who he derides and denigrates. And the list is long. But it's not about that. It's about you. It's about your families and your futures, and each of us should be telling you what we intend to do in the job. Now, I have this old-fashioned idea. I'm asking for your vote. I should tell you what I'm going to do, what my plans are. So Tim Kane and I have actually put out this little paperback book. And I see somebody holding one in the front row. It's called, not surprisingly, 'Stronger Together.' You can pick it up at a bookstore or an airport, wherever they sell paperbacks. And you can see what we're trying to do, and where we're going to get the money to pay for it. And the simple answer to that is, we're going to make the wealthy and corporations finally pay their fair share to support America.\n\nNow, my friends, my opponent has a very different vision for America. He actually bragged about gaming the system to get out of paying his fair share in taxes, maybe not paying any taxes at all. And what I really find so disturbing about this is he spends all of his time just dumping on America. Calling us a third world country. Saying our military is a disaster. That everything about America is in bad shape. But then it's probably true, he hasn't paid a penny in federal taxes to actually support our military, or our vets, or our schools, or our roads, or our education systems. He actually is proud of the fact that he lets everybody else pay taxes. He says that makes him smart.\n\nWell, I'll tell you what, if not paying taxes makes him smart, what does that make the rest of us? My husband and I have put 40 years of our tax returns out into the public. You can go and look at them, and you can see that we've been blessed, and we're grateful for that. But we have paid the highest marginal tax rates, and we are glad we could, because we have both benefited from this great country of ours, and we want to pass that on to the next generation and the one after that.\n\nDonald Trump is also proud that he rooted for the housing crisis back in 2008 and -9. Think about that. Five million families lost their homes. And he rooted for it because he said he could make money off of it. He even said that it is just business. Well, what kind of person believes that - that throwing people out of their homes, foreclosing on them, destroying the dreams of hardworking people is just business? Well, I'll tell you, that's a person who should never be president because they don't understand the American dream and how hard it is for people to make it.\n\nSo look, I think after - Thank you. I think after what we saw Monday night, we'll have two more debates to be able to contrast and compare. I have no idea what he's going to say the next time. But you know, I will spend some time preparing for it.\n\nBut we can't do any of the things that I just talked about or anything that you see in our book without your help. The future of our country, the future of our economy and the future of our society will be on the ballot. It breaks my heart to see all the mean-spirited, divisive, bigoted things that are being said in our country. We can have our differences, for heaven sakes. We're Americans; that's in our DNA. But we should respect one another. We should listen to one another. That's the way we're going to get things done together.\n\nAnd so I want you to join this campaign. The election will be close, but we can win Iowa and we're going to win on November 8th. So if you can, text 'Join,' J-o-i-n, to 47246, or go to hillaryclinton.com and sign up to volunteer. If you're not sure if you're registered, see these signs, 'I Will Vote?' Iwillvote.com. You can go to iwillvote.com, put in your name and your address, to make sure you're registered. Because sometimes people get dropped off the registration lists and they are surprised when they show up to vote that they're not on it. So check that out. And then, vote, and get everybody you know to vote. And I hope that a lot of you will go to vote after today, after this beautiful rally we're having. Because we will prove that we are stronger together. And you know what else we'll prove? We will prove that love trumps hate.\n\nThank you all very much.\u0000","48":"Thank you, it is so great to be here in Florida.\nIn 26 days, we are going to win the state, and we are going to win the White House.\n\nOur movement is about replacing a failed and corrupt political establishment with a new government controlled by you, the American People.\n\nThere is nothing the political establishment will not do, and no lie they will not tell, to hold on to their prestige and power at your expense.\n\nThe Washington establishment, and the financial and media corporations that fund it, exists for only one reason: to protect and enrich itself.\n\nThe establishment has trillions of dollars at stake in this election. As an example, just one single trade deal they'd like to pass, involves trillions of dollars controlled by many countries, corporations and lobbyists.\n\nFor those who control the levers of power in Washington, and for the global special interests they partner with, our campaign represents an existential threat.\n\nThis is not simply another 4-year election. This is a crossroads in the history of our civilization that will determine whether or not We The People reclaim control over our government.\n\nThe political establishment that is trying everything to stop us, is the same group responsible for our disastrous trade deals, massive illegal immigration, and economic and foreign policies that have bled this country dry. The political establishment has brought about the destruction of our factories and our jobs, as they flee to Mexico, China and other countries throughout the world. Our just-announced jobs numbers are anemic, and our gross domestic product, or GDP, is barely above one percent. Workers in the United States, were making less than they were almost 20 years ago - and yet they are working harder.\n\nIt's a global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class, stripped our country of its wealth, and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities.\n\nJust look at what this corrupt establishment has done to our cities like Detroit and Flint, Michigan - and rural towns in Pennsylvania, Ohio, North Carolina and across our country. They have stripped these towns bare, and raided the wealth for themselves and taken away their jobs.\n\nThe Clinton Machine is at the center of this power structure. We've seen this firsthand in the WikiLeaks documents in which Hillary Clinton meets in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of U.S. sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers.\n\nAnd, likewise, the emails show that the Clinton Machine is so closely and irrevocably tied to media organizations that she is given the questions and answers in advance of her debates. Clinton is also given approval and veto power over quotes written about her in the New York Times. And the emails show the reporters collaborate and conspire directly with the Clinton Campaign on helping her win the election.\n\nWith their control over our government at stake, with trillions of dollars on the line, the Clinton Machine is determined to achieve the destruction of our campaign, which has now become a movement the likes of which our country has never seen before - and we won't let them do that.\n\nThe most powerful weapon deployed by the Clintons is the corporate media. Let's be clear on one thing: the corporate media in our country is no longer involved in journalism. They are a political special interest, no different than any lobbyist or other financial entity with an agenda. And their agenda is to elect the Clintons at any cost, at any price, no matter how many lives they destroy.\n\nFor them, it is a war - and for them, nothing is out of bounds.\n\nThis is a struggle for the survival of our nation. This election will determine whether we are a free nation, or whether we have only the illusion of Democracy but are in fact controlled by a small handful of global special interests rigging the system.\n\nThis is not just conspiracy but reality, and you and I know it.\n\nThe establishment and their media enablers wield control over this nation through means that are well known. Anyone who challenges their control is deemed a sexist, a racist, a xenophobe and morally deformed. They will attack you, they will slander you, they will seek to destroy your career and reputation. And they will lie, lie and lie even more.\n\nThe Clintons are criminals. This is well-documented, and the establishment that protects them has engaged in a massive cover-up of widespread criminal activity at the State Department and Clinton Foundation in order to keep the Clintons in power. Never in history have we seen such a cover-up as this, one that includes the destruction of 33,000 emails, 13 phones, laptops, missing boxes of evidence, and on and on.\n\nPeople who are capable of such crimes against our nation are capable of anything.\n\nAnd so now we address the slander and libels that was just last night thrown at me by the Clinton Machine, the New York Times, and other media outlets, as part of a concerted, coordinated and vicious attack.\n\nIt is not coincidence that these attacks come at the exact same moment, and all together at the same time, as the WikiLeaks documents expose the massive international corruption of the Clinton Machine - including 2,000 more emails this morning\n\nThese claims about me of inappropriate conduct with women are totally and absolutely false - and the Clinton Machine knows it is. It's all fabricated. It's pure fiction and outright lies. These events never happened. The claims are preposterous, ludicrous and defy truth, common sense and logic.\n\nWe already have substantial evidence to dispute these lies, and it will be made public in the appropriate way and at the appropriate time. These lies come from outlets whose past stories, and past claims, have already been discredited. The media outlets did not even attempt to confirm the most basic facts, because even a simple investigation would have shown these are false smears.\n\nWhat's happening to me is no different than what happened to other innocent people, like the story written in Rolling Stone Magazine - and that magazine should be put out of business.\n\nSix months ago, the New York Times wrote a massive story attacking me, and the central witness they used said the story was false, that she was quoted inaccurately. She said I was a great guy, and never made those remarks.\n\nWe demanded a retraction, but they refused to print it - just like they refused to print the comments from another source who praised me in her book, or the words of another wonderful woman who said nice things.\n\nThat story was a fraud and an embarrassment to the New York Times. It will be part of the lawsuit we are preparing against them. Now today, the same two discredited writers, who should have been fired from the times, tell a totally fabricated and false story that supposedly took place on an airplane more than 30 years ago - another ridiculous tale, no witnesses, no nothing.\n\nAlso, a writer from people magazine who wrote a story on Melania and myself on our first anniversary. The story was lovely but last night we hear, after 12 years, a new claim that I made inappropriate advances. I ask a very simple question, why wasn't it part of the story that appeared 12 years ago? I was one of the biggest stars on television, and it would have been one of the biggest stories of the year. Take a look at her words. It would have been the headline. No, it only appears 26 days before the election.\n\nThis invented account has already been debunked by eyewitness testimony - the very witness identified by the author has said the story is entirely false.\n\nThis weekend, the New York Times published a full-page hit piece with another claim from an individual who has been totally discredited based on the emails and letters she has sent to our office over the years. But the New York Times refused to use the evidence we presented them. Others have likewise were presented with this story, but after seeing the evidence we provided, refused to print it.\n\nThis is part of a concerted effort, led by the New York Times, which is fighting desperately for its relevance and survival, and which probably won't even be around in a few years based on its financial outlook, has become more and more vicious and vile.\n\nI will not allow the Clinton Machine to turn this campaign into a discussion of their slanders and lies, but will remain focused on the issues facing the American people.\n\nBut let me state this as clearly as I can. These attacks are orchestrated by the Clintons and their media allies. They are false and slanderous in every respect. We are now less than a month from the most important election of our lifetime - indeed one the most important elections in modern history - and the polls show us in a dead heat. And the new Rasmussen poll shows us 2 points ahead.\n\nSo now, the Clinton Machine, has put forward a small handful of people out of the tens of thousands I have met, worked with and employed - in order to make wild and false allegations that fail to meet even the most basic test of common sense. Again, this is nothing more than an attempt to destroy our movement and for the Clintons to keep their corrupt control over this government.\n\nWhen I declared my candidacy, I knew what bad shape our country was in. I had seen firsthand the corruption and the sickness that has taken over our politics. I knew they would throw every lie they could at me, and my family, and my loved ones.\n\nI knew they would stop at nothing to try to stop me.\n\nBut I take all of these slings and arrows for you. I take them for our movement, so that we can have our country back.\n\nOur great civilization, here in America and across the civilized world, has come upon a moment of reckoning.\n\nWe've seen it in the United Kingdom, where they voted to liberate themselves from global government and global trade deals and global immigration deals that have destroyed their sovereignty.\n\nBut the central base of world political power is here in America, and it is our corrupt political establishment that is the greatest power behind the efforts at radical globalization and the disenfranchisement of working people.\n\nTheir financial resources are unlimited. Their political resources are unlimited. Their media resources are unlimited. And, most importantly, the depths of their immorality is unlimited.\n\nOur political establishment has no soul.\n\nI knew these false attacks would come. I knew this day would arrive. And I knew the American people would rise above it and vote for the future they deserve.\n\nThe only thing that can stop the Corrupt Clinton Machine is you. The only force strong enough to save this country is you. The only people brave enough to vote out this corrupt establishment is you, the American People.\n\nThey control the Department of Justice, and they even clandestinely meet with the Attorney General of the United States - in the back of her airplane, while on the runway - for 39 minutes - to most likely discuss her reappointment in a Clinton Administration just prior to the Attorney General making a decision over whether or not to prosecute Hillary Clinton.\n\nLikewise, they have corrupted the Director of the FBI to the point at which stories are already saying the great men and women who work for the FBI are embarrassed and ashamed to what he's done to one of our great institutions. Hillary Clinton is guilty of all of the things that Director Comey stated at his press conference and Congressional hearings, and far more - and yet he let her off the hook, while others lives are being destroyed for far less.\n\nThis is a conspiracy against you, the American people.\n\nThis is our moment of reckoning as a society and as a civilization.\n\nI didn't need to do this. I built a great company, and I had a wonderful life. I could have enjoyed the benefits of years of successful business for myself and my family, instead of going through this absolute horror show of lies, deceptions and malicious attacks. I'm doing it because this country has given me so much, and I feel strongly it was my turn to give back.\n\nSome people warned me this campaign would be a journey to hell. But they are wrong, it will be a journey to heaven because we will help so many people.\n\nIn my former life, I was an insider as much as anybody else - and I know what's like to be an insider. Now I am being punished for leaving their special club and revealing to you their great scam. Because I used to be part of the club, I'm the only one who can fix it. I'm doing this for the people, and this movement is just right - and we will take back this country for you and Make America Great Again.\n\nThe corrupt establishment knows that we are an existential threat to their criminal enterprise. They know, that if we win, their power is gone and returned to you. The clouds hanging over our government can be lifted, and replaced with a bright future - but it all depends on whether we let the New York Times decide our future, or whether we let the American people decide our future.\n\nIf this Clinton Campaign of Destruction is allowed to work, then no other highly successful person - which is what our country needs - will ever again run for this office.\n\nI will not lie to you. These false attacks hurt. To be lied about, to be slandered, to be smeared so publicly and before your family, is painful.\n\nWhat the Clinton Machine is doing to me, and my family, is egregious beyond words. It is reprehensible beyond description.\n\nBut I also know, it's not about me - it's about all of you. It's about all of us, together, as a country.\n\nIt's about the Veterans who need medical care, the mothers who've lost children to terrorism and crime, it's about the inner cities and the border towns who desperately need our help, it's about the millions of jobless Americans. This election is about the people being crushed by Obamacare, and it's about defeating ISIS and appointing Supreme Court Justices who will defend our Constitution.\n\nThis election is also about the African-American and Hispanic communities whose communities have been plunged into crime, poverty and failing schools by the policies of Hillary Clinton. They've robbed these citizens of their future, and I will give them their hope, jobs and opportunities back. I will deliver.\n\nThis election is about every man, woman and child in our country who deserves to live in safety, prosperity and peace.\n\nWe will rise above the lies, the smears, and the ludicrous slanders from ludicrous reporters.\n\nWe will vote for the country we want.\n\nWe will vote for the future we want.\n\nWe will vote for the politics we want.\n\nWe will vote to put this corrupt government cartel out of business. We will remove from our politics the special interests who have betrayed our workers, our borders, our freedoms, and our sovereign rights as a nation. We will end the politics of profit, we will end the rule of special interests, we will put a stop to the raiding of our country - and the disenfranchisement of our people.\n\nOur Independence Day is at hand, and it arrives, finally, on November 8th. Join me in taking back our country, and creating a bright and glorious new dawn for our people.\u0000","49":"Hello, Winston-Salem! Hello Wake Forest! It is so great to be here in this beautiful city at this extraordinary time and to have a chance to be with so many, including the Wake Forest family. And it doesn't get any better than being here with our most amazing First Lady Michelle Obama. I want to thank everyone who has filled this arena, and I especially want to thank Dr. Hatch and the staff team and students at Wake Forest University. I will never forget being here with the legendary Maya Angelou, one of the most powerful voices our country has ever heard.\nSo I couldn't think of a better place to come back to with another woman whose voice we need now more than ever. I want to say what I think is obvious but can't be said enough, and that is this may be one of the most, if not the most important election of our lifetimes, no matter our age. But for young people it will be so consequential because every election is about the future. And this one is about whether we build on the progress we've made, the legacy that President Obama has built or rip it away and go backwards. So we have a lot of work to do.\n\nAnd I don't mean just in the presidential race. Let's be sure to elect Roy Cooper, the next governor of North Carolina. He will always put the people of North Carolina first. And he will repeal HB2 - because he knows that discrimination is wrong. It's bad for business, and it's against North Carolina's values.\n\nAnd let's send Deborah Ross to the United States Senate. She will be an independent voice for the working families in this state, and she will help break through the gridlock in Washington.\n\nAnd unlike her opponent, Deborah Ross has never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump. And remember, it is not just Roy's name and Deborah's name or my name that's going to be on the ballot. So much of what we care about -- so much that's at stake in the election is, too.\n\nVoting rights are at stake. And if you care about this sacred right, and want to make sure our leaders of both parties do their part to protect and strengthen it -- not chip away at it, you've got to vote in this election. And so I hope, after all North Carolina has gone through with the efforts to suppress people's votes, you will turn out and say, \"No. We demand the right to vote.\"\n\nAnd supporting our veterans is at stake. If you believe that America should stand with those who served because they served us, then you've got to vote. And so when you think about yourselves, your families, people you know who've worn the uniform of our country, the best way to make clear that we respect the military, and we will do everything we can to make sure they and their families have what they need as they sacrificed for us, is to show up and vote.\n\nAnd climate change is at stake. Now, I shouldn't have to say this in 2016, but I will. If you believe in science, right? And you know that climate change is real and demands action right now - you've got to show up and vote in this election.\n\nImmigration is at stake. If you believe that we need to fix our broken system, keep families together, and give people who love America a path to citizenship - you've got to vote.\n\nAnd marriage equality is at stake, too. If you believe everyone deserves to be treated equally in America, no matter who they are or who they love - then you've got to turn out and vote in this election.\n\nGood jobs that pay good wages are at stake. Investing in our roads and our bridges and our water systems and all the work that needs to be done in our country. That really matters, and we can put millions of people to work and have a more competitive economy. That's why we've proposed a very big jobs program, because I don't want anybody willing to work in this country not to have a good job with a rising income to support themselves and their families. If you believe that, then you've got to come out and vote.\n\nAnd particularly, for all of the students here, affordable college education is at stake. And not only that, relief from student debt that you already have is at stake. So if you believe as we do that everyone should be able to afford to go to college and graduate and that everyone should be able to pay down and pay off their debt, then you've got to get out and vote in this election.\n\nAnd dignity for women and girls. Again, I wish I didn't have to say this, right? But indeed, dignity and respect for women and girls is also on the ballot in this election. And I want to thank our First Lady for her eloquent, powerful defense of that basic value. So I think you're getting the idea here that I think everything we care about is at stake in this election. So you've got to vote - and get your friends and families and neighbors to vote too.\n\nAnd don't just take it from me because I think you've heard some really compelling voices say the same thing, and one of them is here with us today, right? There are so many things I admire about our First Lady. Michelle reminds us to work hard, stay true to our values, be good to one another and never, ever stop fighting for what we believe in.\n\nShe has spent eight years as our First Lady advocating for girls around the world to go to school and have the same opportunities as boys. She has worked for healthier childhoods for our kids here at home, better nutrition, more exercise. And we are seeing the results. We actually are seeing kids who are healthier, something that she was determined to try to achieve. She has encouraged more young people to go to college and follow your dreams, and she has supported America's military families, who serve and sacrifice as well for our country.\n\nNow, it hasn't been all hard work. She played a mean round of 'Carpool Karaoke,' and among the many real privileges I've had is to see the President and the First Lady dance. Wow, one could only hope. Now, she also planted an amazing vegetable garden at the White House - and I can promise you, if I win, I will take good care of it, Michelle.\n\nAnd boy - thank you! Boy, didn't she dazzle the world with that wise and beautiful speech at the Democratic National Convention this summer?\n\nAnd I have now, I have now stood on the debate stage for four and a half hours with Donald Trump, and if you see any of those debates, well, that has proved once and for all that I have the stamina to be President and Commander in Chief. But there were times during those three debates, the loop running in my head was what Michelle said at the convention, right? 'When they go low, we go high.'\n\nAnd on top of all that, just by being herself every day, never missing an opportunity to honor her parents for the hard work and sacrifice that set her on her way, she has shown every little girl and boy in America that there are no limits to what they can achieve if they work hard and do right and believe in themselves.\n\nSeriously - is there anyone more inspiring than Michelle Obama?\n\nAnd maybe, maybe it's especially meaningful to me because I do know something about being First Lady of the United States, and I'm going to state the obvious. It's not easy. You've got so many people counting on you. You've got the eyes of the world on you. And when you're trying to raise your children as she is and I did, and give them the space and support they need to have as normal and safe and fulfilling childhoods as possible - that makes it even harder. I used to hang out in the main hall on the second floor of the White House around the time Chelsea would come home from school just to be sure I got to see her and see what happened that day and try to figure out what I needed to be thinking about and doing for her.\n\nAnd let's be real - as our first African-American First Lady, she's faced pressures I never did. And she's handled them with pure grace. By any standard, she has been an outstanding First Lady who has made us all so proud.\n\nAnd she and the President, she and the President have been such wonderful friends to me and my family. It has just meant the world, the world to me, it really has.\n\nI want to say just one thing about the First Lady's work. I mentioned military families. She's been their fierce champion. And military families have come up against a lot in this election. It just made me boil when Donald Trump disrespected a Gold Star family, Mr. and Mrs. Khan. He still hasn't apologized to them.\n\nHe actually made it worse - just yesterday, he said again that if America had only made him President years ago, their son, Captain Khan, would still be alive. Honestly, I don't -- I don't understand how anyone would want to rub salt in the wounds of a grieving family.\n\nAnd he keeps insulting our military. Yesterday, when he heard that a retired Army colonel and former dean of the Army War College said that Donald doesn't understand military strategy, Trump said, 'I'll teach him a couple things.' Well actually, Donald, you're the one who's got a lot to learn about the military and everything else that makes America great. Starting by learning about the dignity and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform and their families. And he should learn from Michelle Obama how a leader supports them, not disrespects them!\n\nNo one knows the stakes in this election better than our First Lady. Because all the progress that we've achieved under President Obama's leadership is at stake - he pulled our economy out of the biggest ditch that it was in when he became president. He saved the auto industry, he cracked down on Wall Street, he has tackled healthcare, climate change, civil rights, and so much else.\n\nAnd all the work that we've done to strengthen our relationships with other countries and secure our leadership in the world is also at stake.\n\nNow, I for one, and I hope all of you, do not want all that hard work - by our President and our First Lady and by millions of Americans - to be wiped away. We cannot let that happen.\n\nWe've got to do everything in our power to get everyone out to vote. To understand no matter what issue you care about, it truly is on the ballot. Now, this has been a hard election at times. It's gotten pretty ugly, hasn't it? We've all felt it - especially our kids.\n\nI hear this from parents and children across our country - kids write me notes, they hand me little cards and notes when I shake hands with them. Their parents write to me, teachers talk to me. Kids are scared, kids are scared by the rhetoric they're hearing, right? I see the educators' heads nodding.\n\nLittle girls hear the ugly things that have been said about women in this campaign, and it makes them feel terrible and doubt themselves - and that is why it is important for voices, like our First Lady's, to stand up and say, 'Wait a minute, respecting women and girls is so important,' and it is especially important for us to send that message to our children, boys and girls alike.\n\nOur kids are scared that they're going to be sent out of the country because their parents are immigrants or they're immigrants. They're scared if they're Muslim, or have a disability. I got a letter from a parent -- a mom from Wisconsin, I think, who adopted her son Felix from Ethiopia when he was a toddler. He just turned 11 years old - he wrote my campaign to let me know he was now 11 years old. I love it when little kids do little birthday remembrances. America is the only country he's ever known. One day, he turned to his mom and asked, 'If Donald Trump becomes President, is he going to make me go back to Ethiopia?'\n\nNow that honestly breaks my heart. We've got to make sure all our kids know that America has a place for you -- the American Dream is big enough for you. And then, we've got to make sure they learn the right lessons about how to treat people. I saw that sign, I believe in love and kindness, right?\n\nWell, here's one place to start. We know that bullying is a real problem in our classrooms, our playgrounds and online - and teachers have reported that this election has made it worse. So I want you to know, we're going to launch a major new effort to help states and communities and schools and families end bullying wherever it takes places. And we will work together to make the internet a safer space for kids, invest in front-line professionals like guidance counselors and social workers and school nurses and psychologists to support kids who've been targeted, like the young woman I met in Iowa who told me she was bullied because of her asthma. This has got to stop. And I can't think of anything more important than making sure every single one of our kids knows that they loved just as they are.\n\nSo ultimately, my friends, as Michelle reminded us this election is about our kids, and in my case, my grandkids. Their lives and their futures -- nothing is more important to me than that. I've been fighting for kids throughout my career. I will fight for them every single day of my presidency. So we have a job to do.\n\nStarting right now, let's come together. Let's work together. And let's be hopeful and optimistic and unified in the face of division and hate. Bring people together in a spirit of mutual respect to solve shared challenges. Let's have each other's backs, lift each other up, not tear each other down.\n\nLet's go out and win this election to make sure we do exactly that - for Roy Cooper, Deborah Ross, and all of us. Let's make sure you vote early. Vote as soon as you can, vote this afternoon. I'm excited about what we're going to see happen here in North Carolina, and I am so excited to be introducing our amazing First Lady Michelle Obama!\u0000","50":"Thank you. \nThank you very much thank you ladies and gentlemen. Thank you please sit down. Thank you.\n\nIt's my privilege to be here in Gettysburg hallowed ground where so many lives were given in service to freedom. Amazing place.\n\nPresident Lincoln served at a time of division like we've never seen before. It is my hope that we can look at his example to heal the divisions we are living through right now. We are a very divided nation.\n\nI'm not a politician and have never wanted to be a politician, believe me. But, when I saw the trouble our country was in I knew I couldn't stand by and watch any longer.\n\nOur country has been so good to me. I love our country and I felt I had to act. \n\nI've seen the system up-close-and-personal for many years. I've been a major part of it.\n\nI know how the game works in Washington and on Wall Street and I know how they've rigged the rules of the game against everyday Americans. The rules are rigged.\n\nNearly one in four Americans in their prime earning years isn't even working. One in five households have no one with a job. 45 million Americans are on food stamps and 47 million are living in poverty.\n\nWe have failed our inner cities and in so doing have failed our African-American and Hispanic communities.\n\nWe've misguided military adventures overseas and wars that go on forever that just cannot be won by the people that are doing it now. They don't know how to win the wars at home.\n\nWe have our great veterans dying while waiting for medical care.\n\nChange has to come from outside our very broken system. Our system is broken.\n\nThe fact that Washington and the Washington establishment has tried so hard to stop our campaign is only more proof that our campaign represents the kind of change that only arrives once-in-a-lifetime. \n\nThe system is totally rigged and broken. First, the issue of voter fraud. According to Pew, there are 24 million voter registrations in the United States that are either invalid or significantly significantly inaccurate. And when I say that there are such inaccuracies, it's unbelievable.\n\n1.8 million dead people are registered to vote and some of them are voting. I wonder how that happens.\n\n2.8 million people are registered in more than one state is a number folks. These are numbers.\n\nFourteen percent of non-citizens are registered to vote. The system is also rigged because Hillary Clinton should have been precluded from running for the presidency of the United States. But, the FBI and the Justice Department covered up her crimes which included lying to the FBI and congress on numerous occasions and included saying I do not recall to the FBI on 39 separate times.\n\nShe recalls everything else, but 39 separate times she said I do not recall. Well, that's a lies. Also, then there is the deletion of at least 33,000 emails after receiving a subpoena from the United States Congress that's after receiving the subpoena as an example.\n\nIt was announced this week that the highly-respected four-star general James Cartwright, maybe sentenced to up to five years in prison with a massive fine for lying on one occasion to the FBI. He said he did that for national security reasons.\n\nHighly respected man. A four-star general. This took place two days ago. How must he feel. A big part of the rigging of this election is the fact that Hillary is being allowed to run despite having broken so many laws on so many different occasions.\n\nWhy is she allowed to run? The dishonest, mainstream media is also part in a major part of this corruption. They're corrupt. They lie and fabricate stories to make a candidate that is not their preferred choice, look as bad and even dangerous as possible.\n\nAt my rallies, they never show or talk about the massive crowd size and try to diminish all of our events.\n\nOn the other hand, they don't show the small size of Hillary's crowds but in fact talk about how many people are there. Very small crowds. You know it. They know it.\n\nOver the last two days, three highly respected national polls said we're in first place and one of those pollsters was the most accurate pole on the last two cycles. But, the media refuses to even say it or put that word out. They refused to talk about it.\n\nThey're trying desperately to suppress my vote and the voice of the American people as an example of the power structure and fighting. AT&T is buying Time Warner and the CNN. A deal we will not approve in my administration because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\n\nLikewise, Amazon, which through its ownership controls the Washington Post, should be paying massive taxes. It's not paying and it's a very unfair playing field and you see what that's happening and what that's doing to department stores all over the country.\n\nVery very unfair and you're talking about billions and billions of dollars. They should be paying those taxes.\n\nAdditionally, Comcast purchase of NBC concentrates far too much power in one massive entity that is trying to tell the voters what to think and what to do. Deals like this destroy democracy and we'll look at breaking that deal up and other deals like that.\n\nThis should never ever have been approved in the first place. They're trying to poison the mind of the American voter. Every woman lied when they came forward to hurt my campaign. Total Fabrication. The events never happened, never. All of these liars will be sued after the election is over but a simple phone called placed to the biggest newspapers or television networks get them wall-to-wall coverage with virtually no fact-checking whatsoever.\n\nHere is why this is relevant to you. If they can fight somebody like me who has unlimited resources to fight back, just look at what they can do to you. Your jobs. Your security. Your education. Your healthcare. The violation of religious liberty. The theft of your second amendment. The loss of your factories, your homes, and much more.\n\nLook at what they've done to you with your jobs. It is just been lined on video, that the violent protests at some of my rallies, like in Chicago, where police and others were seriously hurt. You saw that blood pouring down their face were caused by paid, paid DNC and Clinton campaign operatives.\n\nNow, we didn't know this. We didn't know, this just came out two days ago on tape. We didn't know this. We were amazed at the level of violence. These were paid operatives. Paid by the DNC and probably the Clinton campaign.\n\nThis is a criminal act. Policemen were badly hurt and so were many others and these people prosecuted. But because of the rigged system they probably won't be. Just like we found out about these paid violent protesters, it was probably the DNC and the Clinton campaign that put forward these liars with their fabricated stories. But, we'll find out their involvement at a later date through litigation and I look so forward to doing.\n\nThe rigging of the system is designed for one reason, to keep the corrupt establishment and special interests in power at your expense and everybody's expense.\n\nI have no special interest but you the American Vogel. \n\nI didn't have to do this, believe me. There's nothing easy about it but I had to do it.\n\nI love our country.\n\nI love the people of our country and I felt I had to do it. \n\nThank you. One thing we all know is that we will never solve our problems by relying on the same politicians who created these problems in the first place.\n\nHillary Clinton is not running against me, she's running against change and she's running against all of the American people and all of the American voters. \n\nWe now find ourselves at that very special fork in the road, do we repeat the mistakes of the past or do we choose to believe that a great future yet unwritten still lies ahead for us and for our wonderful beloved country. \n\nI think it does.\n\nI know it does.\n\nMy economic plan will deliver at least 25 million jobs in one decade. Now, our jobs have been taken away. They've gone to Mexico. They've gone to so many other countries. It's a one lane highway where they get the jobs, they get the factories, they get the money, and we get the drugs and we get the unemployment and it's going to change.\n\nBelieve me it's going to change. \n\nAnd that goes for all countries. When you look at China, when you look at every trade deal we have, is horrible and we should be ashamed of a people and the people that let those deals happen.\n\nThey're defective and they knew they were defective and they were done for a reason. And believe me they will be unwound so fast and we will have trade. We will have great trade and it'll be free trade but it'll be fair trade and it'll be real.\n\nMy security plan, so important.\n\nThey've taken the jobs from us.\n\nMy security plan will bring safety to our poorest communities.\n\nMy ethics plan will end corruption in our government.  We will. Corruption is massive.\n\nWe will drain the swamp in Washington DC and replace it with a new government of, by, and for the people. \n\nThat is why I have chosen Gettysburg to unveil this contract. I'm asking the American people to rise above the noise and the clutter of our broken politics and to embrace that great faith and optimism that has always been the central ingredient in the American character and there's nothing better or stronger than the American character. \n\nI am asking the American people to dream big once again.\n\nWhat follows is my 100-day action plan to Make America Great Again. It's a contract between Donald J Trump and the American voter - and begins with bringing honesty, accountability and change to Washington DC.\n\nTherefore, on the first day of my term of office, my administration will immediately pursue the following six measures to clean up the corruption and special interest collusion in Washington, DC:\n\nFIRST, a Constitutional Amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress. \n\nSECOND, a hiring freeze on all federal employees to reduce federal workforce through attrition exempting military, public safety, and public health. \n\nTHIRD, a requirement that for every new federal regulation, two existing regulations must be eliminated. Regulations are killing our country and our jobs. \n\nFOURTH, a 5 year-ban on White House and Congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they leave government service, making a fortune. \n\nFIFTH, a lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government, very bad.\n\nSIXTH, a complete ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections, that's what's happening. \n\nOn the same day, I will begin taking and really taking strongly 7 actions to protect American workers. Our American workers have been treated so badly by politicians that don't have their interest at heart and we are going to change that. We're going to change that very very fast.\n\nFIRST, I will announce my intention to totally renegotiate NAFTA one of the worst deals our country has ever made signed by Bill Clinton or withdraw from the deal under Article 2205. \n\nSECOND, I will announce our withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership a potential disaster for our country. \n\nTHIRD, I will direct my Secretary of the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator. China is a currency manipulator. What they have done to us by playing currency is very sad and I don't blame them. They have been very smart. I blame our politicians for letting this take place. So easy to stop so easy to stand.\n\nFOURTH, I will direct the Secretary of Commerce and U.S. Trade Representative to identify all foreign trading abuses that unfairly impact American workers and direct them to use every tool under American and international law to end those abuses immediately. \n\nFIFTH, very importantly I will lift the restrictions on the production of $50 trillion dollars' worth of job producing American energy reserves,  including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal and we will put our miners back to work.\n\nSIXTH, I will lift the Obama-Clinton roadblocks that allow for this vital energy infrastructure projects to forward. We have roadblocks like you've never ever seen. Environmental blocks, structural blocks, we're going to allow the Keystone Pipeline and so many other things to move forward. Tremendous numbers of jobs and good for our country.\n\nSEVENTH, we are going to cancel billions in payments to U.N. climate change programs  and use the money to fix America's water and environmental infrastructure. We're paying billions and billions and billions of dollars. We're going to fix our own environment. .\n\nAdditionally, on the first day, I will take the following five actions to restore security and the constitutional rule of law. We have to do that.\n\nFIRST, cancel every unconstitutional executive action, memorandum and order issued by President Obama.\n\nSECOND, begin the process of selecting a replacement for Justice Scalia whose wife by the way has a Trump sign. His wife is a phenomenal woman. Has a Trump sign in her front yard, isn't that nice? I just found that out this morning. From one of the 20 judges on my list, you know we're going to make great decisions from twenty outstanding judges on a list that we submitted who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. \n\nTHIRD, we will cancel all federal funding to Sanctuary Cities. \n\nFOURTH, we will begin removing the more than 2 million criminal illegal immigrants from the country these are drug dealers, gang heads, gang members, killers, and cancel visas to foreign countries that won't take them back  and when Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State and they had someone who was bad, really bad and they brought him back to the country and the country wouldn't take him. She said we'll bring him back; we don't want to force the country to take him. There won't be one such instance if I become president. \n\nFIFTH, We're going to suspend immigration from terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur.  And if you look at Syria and the migration, we're taking in thousands and thousands of people into our country. We have no idea who they are, what their thought process is, where they come from and Hillary Clinton wants to increase the number of those thousands and thousands currently pouring by 550%. Radical, Islamic terror is right around the corner. We have to be so tough, so smart, so vigilant. We can't allow that to happen  we have enough problems.  All vetting of people coming into our country will be considered extreme vetting. We will be very careful.\n\nNext, I will work with Congress to introduce the following broader legislative measures and fight for their passage within the first 100 days of my Administration:\n\n1. Middle Class Tax Relief and Simplification Act. An economic plan designed to grow the economy 4% per year and create at least 25 million new jobs through massive tax reduction and simplification, in combination with trade reform, regulatory relief, and lifting the restrictions on American energy.  We need that so badly. We need jobs. Our jobs have left us. Our good jobs have really left us.\n\nThe largest tax reductions are for the middle class.  Who have been forgotten. Called the forgotten man and woman. They have been forgotten. A middle-class family with 2 children will get basically a 35% tax cut. And that's what they can use and that money will go back into the economy. The current number of brackets will be reduced from 7 to 3, and tax forms will likewise be greatly simplified. \n\nThe business rate will be lowered from 35 to 15 percent, and the trillions of dollars of American corporate money overseas can now be brought back at a 10 percent rate. It's stuck. We can't bring it back. Two and a half to five trillion dollars. Companies can't get it back into the country. Some companies are actually leaving not only because taxes are so high but because the can't get their money and they are actually leaving to get their money. We are going to simplify that. We're going to have them bring the money back into our country and use the money and spend the money on building our country. \n\n2. The Offshoring Act Establishes tariffs to discourage companies from laying off their workers in order to relocate in other countries and ship their products back to the U.S. tax-free. \n\nThey leave the United Stated like carrier like forward like so many others. They leave the United States and fire all of their employees. They go to Mexico or another country. They build a beautiful brand new plant. They hire other people. They then take their air conditioners, their cars, whatever they're making. They send it tax free across what will be a very strong border believe me  but they send it tax free across the border and what do we end with we have?\n\nWe have unemployment, tremendous losses, and we have none of the benefits. So we will establish tariffs that when they do that there will be consequences. We will work with them; we will be nice we will be fair but there has to be consequences. And when they know their consequences our companies will stop leaving the United States and going to other countries.\n\n3. American Energy & Infrastructure Act. Leverages public-private partnerships, and private investments through tax incentives, to spur $1 trillion in infrastructure investment over 10 years. Our infrastructure is in such trouble. We've doubled our national debt to 20 trillion dollars under president Obama. In less than 8 years, 10 trillion dollars has been added. Think of it and we haven't fixed anything. We haven't fixed anything. What have we doe? Our roads are broken, our bridges, our tunnels, our hospitals, our schools, and we have 20 trillion in debt. All-time high. That's true, our VA hospitals are in bad shape. VA is in very very bad shape and we will fix that. We are going to work on fixing that  because our veterans are not treated properly. We have illegal immigrants that are treated far better in many instances than our veterans  and we're not going to have that. It is revenue neutral.\n\n4. School Choice and Education Opportunity Act. Redirects education dollars to gives parents the right to send their kid to the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school of their choice.  And so importantly ends common core, brings education supervision to local communities.\n\nWe do so badly on education. If you look at the lists, you see Sweden, Norway, Denmark, different countries at the top. You see us at the bottom and yet by far, per-pupil, more money than anybody and it's not even close. We spend more money per-pupil than anybody not even close. We're at the bottom of the list. Other countries spending far less per-pupil are at the top of the list so obviously our current system is not working. We will change it and we will make it good.  It expands vocational and technical education, which we've totally forgotten about in this country and make 2 and 4-year college more affordable.\n\nHave you ever gone to school and you've been with people that aren't good students but they can fix an engine or they can build a wall or they can do things that you wouldn't even think about because we can use some of the one who build the wall  we're going to need them  we're going to need them but did you ever see that how they are genius at fixing a car? They can do anything, but history, not so good, physics, not so good, we have to open vocational again. \n\nThose are people those are great people.\n\n5. Repeal and Replace Obamacare Act.  Fully repeal Obamacare and replace it with Health Savings Accounts, so we can do that. The Health Savings Account, it's one way there are numerous ways but this one very good way. The ability to purchase health insurance across state lines. We have to do it because that's competition. The politicians won't let go of it because the insurance companies, they don't want competition but we'll open it up. Believe me we will get rid of it I've been saying it for years. And lets states manage Medicaid funds it will be so good. Reforms will also include cutting the red tape at the FDA: there are over 4,000 drugs awaiting approval, and we especially want to speed the approval of life-saving medications. Mean they are looking at drugs that are looking very good and you have terminal patients that it's over, these people are dying, they want to get the drug. They won't be living much longer and we study it for years and years and at some point they have to do what they have to do. They have to do it properly but we have 4,000 different drugs and products waiting in ling for approval and we can't get them approved. We are going to speed up that process very significantly.\n\n6. Affordable Childcare and Eldercare Act. Allows Americans to deduct childcare and elder care from their taxes, incentivizes employers to provide on-site childcare services, and you see that with a couple of companies and it is such a great thing to see and creates tax-free Dependent Care Savings Accounts for both young and elderly dependents, with matching contributions for low-income families.  so good.\n\n7. End Illegal Immigration Act. \n\nFully-funds the construction of a wall on our southern border, don't worry about it. Remember I said Mexico's paying for the wall. With the full understanding that the country Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such wall. Ok. We are going to have the wall; Mexico is going to pay for the wall. Mexico's by the way I met with the President of Mexico 2 months ago, wonderful meeting, wonderful person. But I told him this is a two-way highway not a one-way highway.\n\nWe have our people. We have out take care of our people. Have to protect our people so it's got to be a two-way street otherwise it is going to be a whole different deal. But establishes a 2-year mandatory minimum federal prison sentence, there are people coming in illegally, for illegally re-entering the U.S. after a previous deportation, and a 5-year mandatory minimum for illegally re-entering for those with felony convictions, multiple misdemeanor convictions or two or more prior deportations; so when somebody comes in, we send them out. They come back, they go to prison for quite a while. They come back, they come back again they go five years. Because what is happening is they are coming back ten times and I could go cases after case they come back.Look at what happened in San Francisco five times he came back on the fifth time he killed. Five times. But so many others 110 times came back, killed somebody after ten times. When they get deported they stay out otherwise they have very serious prison terms. They will stay out. Once you do that, they will stay out. Right now, they have no consequence. They have no consequence.\n\nAlso reforms on visa rules to enhance penalties for overstaying and to ensure open jobs are offered to American workers first. \n\n8. Restoring Community Safety Act. Reduces surging crime, drugs and violence by creating a Task Force On Violent Crime and increasing funding for programs that train and assist local police who are doing such a great job, believe me. We increase the resources for federal law enforcement agencies and federal prosecutors to dismantle criminal gangs and put violent offenders behind bars  or out of our country and into the country where they came from. \n\n9. Restoring National Security Act. Which rebuilds our military by eliminating the defense sequester which has been very tough on military and expanding military investment.\n\nNow, at no time, practically, do we need a military like right now. We don't want to use it, but it is peace through strength. We need a strong military. \n\nOur military is so terribly depleted. It also provides Veterans with the ability to receive public VA treatment or attend the private doctor of their choice. If they're waiting on line and I have the plan up and we've gotten as you know tremendous support from veterans, from law enforcement, from veterans, from the military tremendous support. But if they're waiting in line and you see it 22 suicides a day, people don't even believe it, but 22 suicides a day. But if they're waiting in line 47 days, 6 days, 9 days, they can't get to see a doctor and a simple procedure or a simple prescription can solve their problem and they become very sick and they die, they die waiting in line. We're going to give them the power to go across the street to a local doctor, a private doctor, a public hospital, or private hospital, all looking to help and all looking to do business. And we will pay the bill. So much cheaper but much more importantly the veterans will finally be taken care of properly because what they are going through now is unacceptable. \n\nAlso, we are going to protect our vital infrastructure from the new thing, cyber-attack; establishes new screening procedures for immigration to ensure those who are admitted to our country support our people and our values  we want people that love our country or can love our country and people that will love our citizens. \n\nWe want people that can love us and there are ways through talent of determining that and other countries do but we don't. Just come on in folks. Just come on in.\n\n10. Clean up Corruption in Washington Act. Enacts tough new ethics reforms to reduce the corrupting influence of special interests and donors on our politics.\n\nOn November 8th, Americans will be voting for this 100-day plan to restore prosperity to our economy, security to our communities, and honesty to our government. This is my pledge to you. And if we follow these steps, we will once more have a government of, by and for the people. \n\nAnd importantly we will Make America Great Again.\n\nBelieve me.\u0000","51":"Thank you! Thank you all so much!\nWow. It is so great to be back here in Pittsburgh.\n\nI do not think it gets any better than to be accompanied out onto the stage by Dan and Pat Rooney.\n\nI am a big admirer of the Rooney family and I was so honored to serve with Dan when he was our ambassador to Ireland.\n\nThe Rooney family commitment to Pittsburgh is really extraordinary, and it's not just the amazing commitment to the Stealers. As special as that is, but to their roots, what they believe in, their values, and their deep concern for future generations. So I am incredibly humbled to be supported by Dan and Pat and the Rooney family. It means a great deal to both Tim and me.\n\nI also want to thank congressman Mike Doyle who is here with us. Allegheny and county executive Richard Fitzgerald who is here. Mayor Bill Peduto. Mayor John Federman. Pennsylvania attorney general Bruce Beemer. And all the other elected officials, it means a lot for you to be here with us. If all goes well in 17 days, we are looking forward to working with you on behalf of Pittsburgh.\n\nSome of you know that I have a special place in my heart for Pennsylvania, and I am excited about helping, in any way that we can, for Pittsburgh, Allegheny county, and western Pennsylvania to keep moving forward with confidence and optimism about what is possible for the future we want to create together. I am thrilled to be here with Tim Kaine.\n\nI asked him to be my running mate because I knew he would be one of the smartest, toughest, most qualified vice presidents we have ever had. And I also knew he had never lost an election.\n\nI kind of figured that might rub off on me a little bit. Now that I have gotten to spend more time with him, and with his wonderful wife Anne and their family, I am even more confident that he will be such an extraordinary leader for our country. He is not just smart, tough and qualified, Tim Kaine is as good and decent a person as you will ever meet.\n\nI am deeply honored to have him by my side in this campaign. Tim and I are excited by all of the energy and enthusiasm we are seeing across the country, and particularly here in Pennsylvania.\n\nBut both of us, unlike our opponent, do not believe we can do this alone. We believe that we are going to do this by working with all of you. And that we are going to come together in the next 17 days and convince everybody you can to get out and vote because whatever issue you care about, it's going to be on the ballot. It may not be listed, but it will be on the ballot.\n\nWhether you care about new, good jobs with a rising incomes or you care about better education or you care about what we can do to get the cost of prescription drugs down. What ever it is you care about, it is literally going to be on that ballot.\n\nNow, my name and Tim's name may be the ones on the ballot, but we are going to be representing everything that we can do that you hope for our country. And we're going to need help doing that after the election, and that is why I hope you will do everything you can to elect Katie Mcginty, your next senator.\n\nYou know, Katie is the daughter of a Philadelphia police officer. I think she is one of 10 children, right? One of 10 children. She has devoted her professional life to protecting working families. I have known her now for more than 20 years, when she was really young, and I have seen that same can-do spirit. She just gets up every day, and asks what can she do to fight for healthier neighborhoods, to keep our kids and healthy, to fight for cleaner air and cleaner water, to help people make the most out of their own lives.\n\nNow she is running for the senate, because like Tim and I, she believes our economy should work for everyone, not just those at the top.\n\nKatie is exactly the kind of partner we need in the senate. But more importantly, she is exactly the kind of senator that Pittsburgh and western Pennsylvania needs in the senate. We have got to get things done for the people of Pennsylvania and America, and Katie will help us break through the gridlock, actually make a difference in people's lives, help us create more good jobs with rising incomes, guarantee equal pay for women, defending planned parenthood.\n\nAnd I think it is pretty clear when you look at Katie's opponent -- he still refuses to stand up to Donald Trump.\n\nA lot of republicans have. They have had the grit to stand up and say 'he does not represent me'.\n\nBut Pat Toomey heard Donald attack a grieving gold star family who lost their son in Iraq. He heard Donald called Mexican immigrants rapists, he heard him say terrible things about women. He heard him spread the lie that our first black president wasn't really born in America -- how much more does Pat Toomey need to hear? If he doesn't have the courage to stand up to Donald Trump after all this, then can you be sure he will stand up for you when it counts against powerful interests?\n\nSo, you know, when I look at this, I'm thinking to myself, we have work to do in Washington. And I know it's not easy. I understand we have some real challenges. I believe we can do it. I would not be standing here, Tim would not be with me -- but we need people in Washington who put you first, who get up every day thinking about middle-class families, who worry about where you are going to get the money to send your kids to college, how you are going to take care of your mom or dad because they are failing and what are you going to do for them? How are you going to deal with all of the challenges? That is what I try to do my entire life. That is who you should be electing, people who care about you, your families, your children.\n\nNow, as Tim said, he asked if any of you watched the debate on Wednesday. Well, I will tell you, that was the third and last time I will ever have to debate Donald Trump.\n\nI mean, think about this, I have now spent 4 and a half hours on stage with Donald, proving once again I have the stamina to be President and commander in chief.\n\nAnd after every one of those debates, people have said, how did you do that? And really, you just have to be of good cheer when you find yourself in a situation like that. You are in front of 50, 60, 70, 80 million people. So, no matter what he would say, I just kept thinking of all the people I have met throughout this campaign. Just early today I've met Henry over there. Henry is on top of his dad's shoulders, and Henry gave me a note saying he hoped I would be president, and you know, I really want to be president for all of the kids in America to do everything I can to help you.\n\nYou know, I also did have a chance to talk about some of the important concerns people have shared with me. From the first day I started this campaign back in april 2015, people have been telling me what is on their minds, and it is one of the greatest honors.\n\nYou know, sometimes it is just fleeting. I will be in a coffee shop shaking hands or I will come down and shake hands on a rope line, just running into somebody. And that person, that man or woman or that young person takes a moment to stop, looks into my eyes. I can tell they are trying to take my measure, and I am grateful that they take their vote, their choice so seriously. And then they might say something like, I have a really terrible problem in my family. My son or my daughter has gotten addicted to opiates or to heroin. What are you going to do about it? Or maybe they will say, my brother has schizophrenia, and we can't afford to get him the kind of consistent care he needs . Or maybe they will say, I am a diabetic. And the drug company has just raised the cost of insulin, and I can't afford it. What are you going to do about it?\n\nThat is the right question to ask anybody running for president, because at the end of the day, this is about you. As I said the other night, we are going to invest in the middle class. We are going to grow this economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down.\n\nAnd we are going to make sure that we produce a enough good jobs with rising incomes so that every single person, especially every single young person in America can go as far as your hard work and talent will take you.\n\nNow, I've got to say, I believe in hard work. That is how I was raised. I believe you've got to work for what you get in life. But I think we have to knock down some of the barriers that stand in the way of people getting ahead and going as far as they should. For me, that starts by believing in our country.\n\nYou know, there has been no other place in the history of the world that has given so much opportunity to so many. Do we have problems? We have problems. Do we have challenges? Of course we do. We are human beings. But boy, there is no more blessed place. And Donald Trump did something the other night that no other presidential nominee has ever done of either party. He refused to say he would respect the results of this election.\n\nMake no mistakes about this, my friends. He is threatening our democracy. Look, I have lost elections. You don't feel very good the next day, believe me. But we know in our country the difference between leadership and dictatorship, right?\n\nYou know, the peaceful transition of power is one of those things that sets us apart, and whether you support me or my opponent, together we must show we support American democracy. And I believe both Donald Trump and I should be grateful for the opportunities that our country has given us. And the best way to demonstrate that we support our democracy is to turn out and vote. And there is an inspiring story being written by people across America right now. We have just reached a milestone, more than 200 million Americans are registered to vote in this election.\n\nAnd you know what? That includes 50 -- more than 50 million young people. More than ever before. I find that a very hopeful sign. And here in Pennsylvania, hundreds of thousands of more voters are registered then were in 2012. What does this tell us? I think it tells us no matter how much negativity is out there, something exciting is happening right now. People are coming together -- democrats, republicans, independents -- all to reject hate and division.\n\nAnd in the states where they can, people are motivated to vote early, to defend core American values, and embrace a future where every person counts, everyone has a place, everyone can contribute. You see, despite what Donald Trump may think, most Americans really believe we can do better. Most Americans really believe women should be respected.\n\nMost Americans really believe that workers should be paid fairly. Most Americans be-lieve that the United States should work with our allies to lead the world and keep us safe.\n\nThe energy we are seeing in the final weeks of this campaign is about more than winning an election. It is about standing up to the kind of country that we want for ourselves and our children. And it is about the kind of lessons we want to teach our sons and daughters. I want you to know, if Tim and I are fortunate enough to be your president and vice president, we will work with everyone.\n\nNow I imagine here in allegheny county and if you are from further west, you probably know people who are thinking about voting for Donald Trump. And here is what I want you to tell them. I want you to tell them that I understand that they need a president who cares about them, will listen to them, and I want to be their president, too.\n\nBecause whether you agree or disagree with me, whether you vote for me or vote against me, I believe we can disagree without being disagreeable. I have seen that. I know it can happen. And I know there are a lot of people here in Pennsylvania who have a lot of questions. They want to know, how do we move forward better. They want to know about their town where there used to be a lot of jobs and there are not as many any more. They are upset what they see around them. I get that. But anger is not a plan.\n\nAnd we need -- we need to work together. We need plans that will help us deal with the legitimate concerns and questions that people have in Pennsylvania. I think that is what our whole country needs right now. That's what I will try to do. I am not going to pretend that we can snap our fingers and solve our problems. That does not happen in the real world. But I know we can make progress together. The choice we face in this election is stark, especially when it comes to the economy.\n\nTim and I believe when the middle class thrives, America thrives. And when we invest in working families, in the middle class, in small businesses, we can make the economy work again for everybody. I think it is fair to say that both Donald Trump and Pat Toomey have a different perspective. They believe -- and they believe this -- if you give trillions of dollars -- and they mean trillion with a t -- of tax cuts to millionaires, billionaires, corporations, it will all trickle down to everybody else. It has not worked before and it has caused us a lot of messes we have had to clean up, and I have been privileged to see presidents up close and personal -- right. Married to one, that's right. Worked for one.\n\nAnd here is what I know. That when you focus on helping the middle class, you end up lifting everybody. When you focus on helping the top, you help the top. That is not good enough. Donald likes to say he is on the side of American workers, but his actions tell a different story. Yes, he has bought cheap Chinese steel and aluminum for his construction projects. He should be buying good American-made steel that supports good American jobs.\n\nI would like to hear Donald explain to American steelworkers filing for unemployment why he put Chinese steel workers to work, instead of steelworkers here in Pennsylvania. And for all his talk about putting America first, he has made many of his products in 12 different countries. So if he wants to make America great again, why doesn't he start by making things in America? And we now know -- we now know he hasn't paid a dime in federal income taxes for years. He says that makes him smart. Well, I don't know how smart you have to be to lose a billion dollars in a year in the first place. Especially -- answer me this -- how do you lose a billion dollars when you are in the casino business?\n\nNever could figure that out. But what it means is that every one of us is paying more in federal income taxes than a billionaire has. That is wrong and we will end of those kinds of loopholes and gimmicks.\n\nI will tell you what. It also means Donald has contributed zero -- zero for our military, zero for our vets, zero for pell grants to help young people go to college, zero for our highways, zero for everything. And yet he stands up on stage and criticizes America. Well it's unfair and it's wrong. With your help, we will make the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II, jobs in infrastructure. Our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our water systems all need help, and those are a lot of good jobs waiting to be done, jobs that can't be exported out of Pennsylvania.\n\nI believe we can bring advanced manufacturing back to the United States. That is why we will invest $10 billion in a make it in America partnerships that brings together workers and unions and businesses, universities, and community colleges.\n\nSome countries are going to take the lead with precision machineries. Some countries is going to take the lead with 3-d printing. We invented both of those technologies. We should take the lead and we should have the jobs.\n\nWe are also going to fight climate change with clean, renewable energy jobs. And we are going to help small businesses which will create two thirds of all of the new jobs in America. And we are going to defend your right to organize and bargain collectively for higher wages and benefits. Don't let anybody fool you, my friends. assault on worker rights and unions is an assault on the middle class.\n\nIt is time to say loudly and clearly, right to work is wrong for workers and wrong for America.\n\nSo, I have set some big goals. I am excited about what we are going to do. And it's all going to put people to work right here. And sometimes folks say to me, how are you going to get that done? You go to the congress --well first of all, I hope we will elect some or democrats. That will be job number one. Number two, I think it will be a very simple question. Our members of congress, members of the senate going to be on the side of the rich, the powerful, and the wealthy, or on your side? And you know what? They are going to have to answer that question. Because if they stay beholden to the special interest, if they continue to do the bidding of the lobbyist and lawyers and others who stand outside their doors -- I have been in the senate. I have seen it. I know it. If they are going to continue to do the work of those who are already privileged in America, then I want to make sure that they don't come back to Washington after the next election.\n\nWe are in a great, great high school here, and I am so proud to be here.\n\nAnd so, we are going to be a good partner with education, especially with educators. We are going to start with universal pre-k. We want good schools with good teachers in every zip code so every kid gets a world-class education.\n\nAnd I want us to bring technical education back to high school. I think it was a mistake when we took it out.\n\nThere are a lot of good jobs that you can be prepared for in today's economy -- coming out of high school, maybe going to community college, going into an apprenticeship program, and I want to lift up that work. A four-year college degree should not be and is not the only way to have a good job with the rising income and a satisfying life.\n\nWe are going to make public colleges and universities tuition free for any families making less than $125,000 a year. And we are going to help you pay down your college debt.\n\nIt's going to be great. To help you pay it back as a percentage of your income at your job, so you are never on the hook for more than you can afford. I worked on this with Senator Bernie Sanders, and it's going to help save -- it's going to help save people thousands of dollars.\n\nIn fact after a year, maybe after you are here -- you can go to hillaryclin-ton.com\/calculator to see how much your family can save. We want you to know we are going to deliver results for you.\n\nI mean, ultimately it's pretty simple. I think the American dream is big enough for everybody and I want everybody to have your chance to get your piece of the American dream.\n\nSo, there's a lot of work we are going to be doing. We need to raise the national mini-mum wage. People who work full-time should not be mired in poverty. We are, as Tim said, going to guarantee equal pay for women. You know, look, it's not just a woman's issue. If you have a mother, which all of us do -- if you have a mother, a wife, a daughter, or a sister who's working, it's your issue. It's good for the entire family, it's good for our economy.\n\nSo my friends, there is a lot for us to do in the next 17 days. Because we have got to get the word out. We have got to tell everybody what we are doing and why this election is so critically important. And that's where all of you come in. If you do know people who are thinking about voting for our opponent.\n\n Nope!\n\nSecretary  Well, you may. You know, I hope you will stage an intervention.\n\nAnd I do hope you will talk about, you know, the reality versus the demagoguery of what we have seen in this campaign.\n\nYou know, we need to come together around all of the issues that are important to everybody and as I said in the beginning, whatever issue you care about, it's going to be on the ballot. I care a lot about making sure that women and girls are treated with dignity and respect that they deserve in our country.\n\nI care a lot about making sure that we save social security and we ensure that everybody has the benefits that they need in order to be able to live a decent life in retirement.\n\nAnd, boy, do I care a lot about our constitution.\n\nAnd maybe it's because on your behalf I went to 112 countries as your secretary of state. And I met a lot of people who in the us because we have been so steady and so committed to our constitutional system and our values. And what I hope is that you care as deeply as our founders did, as our parents and grandparents did, because maybe they came from somewhere else where they weren't treated right. Maybe they saw firsthand what it meant to be deprived of the rule of law.\n\nYou know, every time Donald Trump says he wants to jail his opponent, meaning me, I think to myself, you know, we don't do that in America. We actually have laws and courts and an independent judiciary.\n\nOr, you know, when he blows up at a journalist or criticizes the press and goes on and on and on.\n\nYou know, I get criticized by the press. I know that is part of our democratic system. We believe in a free press. And boy, if you go to countries where there isn't one, you will understand why that is so important.\n\nAnd when he says there should be a religious test -- a religious test for people at our borders, a country founded on religious freedom. You have to ask yourself, who is going to conduct the test? Are we going to get a quiz? What if the border security official does not believe you? Who gets to decide whether you get to come in or out based on your religion?\n\nAnd if you haven't seen it yet, I hope you will go and look at the extraordinary statement by Mr. Khan on Youtube in a new video that we have put out. You remember, he pulled out a constitution at our convention. And he reveres our constitution. And for good reason. Because he, too, came from a place where the was no rule of law to speak of.\n\nSo, whatever issue you care about, this is an issue that will be decided by this election, and that is why I'm reaching out to republicans, democrats, independents, everyone. I know if we bring our talent, our energy, and our ambition to the work of building our country, we are going to see the best days of America ahead of us, and when your chil-dren and your grandchildren ask what you did in 2016 when everything was on the line, I hope you will say you voted for a better America.\n\nSo, here we go. Just remember -- you've got to get out and vote, you've got to get everybody you know to get out and vote. If you do not know where to vote, please go to iwillvote.com. You can put your information in and, it is the magic of the internet. They will tell you where you are supposed to vote. You can go to hillaryclinton.com and sign up to volunteer. Or you can take your phone out right and text join to 47246. And if we can get all of you and everybody you know involved in this next 17 days, I will tell you this -- it is easy to forget how far our country has come.\n\nThere are a lot of people here -- as I said, whose parents and grandparents came here as immigrants. My grandfather, Hugh Rodam, came as an immigrant, as a young boy and settled in Scranton. And he went to work in the Scranton lace mills, he went to work in his teens, he worked there until he retired at the age of 65. He believed in our country. He believed in the kind of future he could get through his hard work. That is what I want everybody in our country to believe again. We are going to unleash the talent, the innovation, the energy that brought people like my grandfather here, but which we will harness for the future. Don't let anybody tell you America's best days are behind us. Don't believe that for a minute.\n\nWe are going to pull together. We are going to make it clear that confidence and opti-mism, respect for each other, bringing folks together who may disagree but can begin to find common ground is what has always worked and it will work again. Help us. Help us create that kind of future, and help us prove once and for all that love trumps hate.\n\nThank you all.\u0000","52":"Thank you all so much. What an honor and a privilege to speak today to the American Legion.\nI thank Commander Dale Barnett, your vice commanders, and your constitutional officers. You have all done such an incredible job.\n\nThe men and women of the American Legion represent the best of America. Strength, courage, selfless devotion. Your organization, and its members, have done so much to defend our country, our flag, and to advance the cause of Americanism - not Globalism.\n\nWe are in your debt.\n\nI will never let you down.\n\nTogether, we are going to work on so many shared goals. But I want to begin by discussing one goal that I know is so important to all of you: promoting American pride and patriotism in America's schools.\n\nIn A Trump Administration, I plan to work directly with the American Legion to uphold our common values and to help ensure they are taught to America's children. We want our kids to learn the incredible achievements of America's history, its institutions, and its heroes.\n\nWe will stop apologizing for America, and we will start celebrating America.\n\nWe will be united by our common culture, values and principles - becoming One American Nation.\n\nOne country, under one constitution, saluting one American Flag.\n\nThe flag all of you helped to protect and preserve.\n\nThat flag deserves respect, and I will work with American Legion to help to strengthen respect for our flag - and, by the way, we want young Americans to recite the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nIn addition to teaching respect for the flag, we also have to make sure we give our military the tools they need to defend that flag and to deter violence and aggression from our foreign adversaries.\n\nWe will rebuild our depleted military, and pursue a state-of-the-art missile defense. We will do it based on those three famous words: Peace Through Strength.\n\nWe will make sure our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines have the best equipment, training and tools in the world - and we will ensure that they have the best medical care in the world, both in service, and when they return home as civilians.\n\nThat will require a total reform of the Veterans Administration.\n\nI've laid out a ten-step VA reform plan you can review on my website. Here are the basics:\n\nI will appoint a Secretary of Veterans Affairs whose personal mission will be to clean up the VA.\n\nThe Secretary's sole mandate will be to serve our veterans - not bureaucrats, not politicians, but veterans.\n\nI am going to use every lawful authority to remove and discipline anyone who fails our veterans or breaches the public trust.\n\nI will appoint a commission to investigate all the wrongdoing at the VA, and then present those findings to Congress as the basis for reforming the entire system.\n\nWe are going to ensure every veteran in America gets timely access to top-quality care, including the best care in the world for our female veterans.\n\nThe Veterans health system will remain a public system, because it is a public trust. But never again will we allow any veteran to suffer or die waiting for care.\n\nThat means Veterans will have the right to go to a VA facility, or the right to see a private doctor or clinic of their choice - whatever is fastest and best for the veteran. The Veteran will be in control.\n\nShould I have the honor of serving as president, we are also going to start facing the world with confidence again. We are going to uphold the laws of the nation and defend our sovereignty and security - and our border.\n\nI just came back from a great meeting with the President of Mexico, where I expressed my deep respect for the people of his country, and for the tremendous contributions of Mexican-Americans in our country - including to our Armed Services.\n\nI want to again thank him for his gracious hospitality, and express my belief that we can work together to accomplish great things for both of our countries.\n\nWe agreed in the meeting on the need to stop the illegal flow of guns, drugs, cash and people across the border and to take out the cartels.\n\nWe also talked about the importance of working to keep jobs and wealth in our hemisphere. A more prosperous Mexico means fewer illegal border crossings, and a better market for products made in the United States.\n\nWhen I am President, I am going to look at every trade deal we have across the world and see what steps must be taken to protect American jobs and create new opportunities for American workers. We will fight for every last American job.\n\nWe're going to show ourselves and the world again what a strong and growing American economy looks like.\n\nWe are going to give major tax relief to every worker and small business in this country, bring thousands of new companies and millions of new jobs back to our shores - and unleash an American Energy Revolution.\n\nWe will also be appointing justices who will defend our Constitution.\n\nI will nominate men and women to the court who meet the high standard of Antonin Scalia, judges who have the wisdom and integrity to follow the law and not just make it up.\n\nAbove all, these next four years, I will be uncompromising in the defense of the United States and our friends and allies. We are going to end the era of nation-building, and create a new foreign policy - joined by our partners in the Middle East - that is focused on destroying ISIS and Radical Islamic Terrorism. We will extend the hand of friendship to any nation that will work with us in good faith on this vital mission.\n\nAt the same time, we will change our immigration screening procedures to help keep terrorists and extremists out of our country. That includes stopping the influx of Syrian refugees. My opponent wants a 550% increase. I, on the other hand, want to build a safe zone overseas - and use the money saved to invest in America.\n\nIt is time to create a New American Future - for you, your children, and all American children yet to come.\n\nIn this future, we will have an honest government - and that includes an honest State Department, not Pay-For-Play. Government access and favors will no longer be for sale, and important email records will no longer be deleted and digitally bleached.\n\nWe will also have an efficient and responsible federal budget - no more waste, no more throwing away taxpayer dollars.\n\nOnce more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.\n\nIt will be an inclusive society, one that offers hope and opportunity to every part of this country - including our inner cities. We will ensure that every child in this land, including African-American and Hispanic child, is put on the American ladder of success: a good education, and a great job.\n\nWe will follow the noble example of our military men and women, working selflessly across all difference races and incomes and backgrounds, to achieve unity and accomplish amazing things.\n\nLadies and gentlemen of the American Legion, I ask today for the honor of your vote. Working in unison, we can deliver the real American change our country so desperately needs.\n\nWe will make America Strong Again.\n\nWe will Make America Proud Again.\n\nWe will Make America Safe Again.\n\nWe will Make America Great Again.\n\nThank you, and God bless.\u0000","53":"Thank you.\nIn 22 days, we are going to win the state of Wisconsin and we are going to win the White House.\n\nEarly voting is underway, so make sure to send in your absentee ballots.\n\nTogether, we are going to deliver real change that puts America First.\n\nWe are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals, end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, reduce surging crime, cut taxes and regulations, lift the restrictions on American energy, end common core, and repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.\n\nYour jobs will come back under a Trump Administration. Your incomes will go up under a Trump Administration. Your taxes will go way down under a Trump Administration. Your companies won't be leaving Wisconsin under a Trump Administration.\n\nWe are also going to end government corruption.\n\nHillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to run for President.\n\nNewly-released FBI documents made public today reveal just how deep the corruption goes. The under-Secretary of State, Patrick Kennedy, pressured the FBI to un-classify emails from Hillary's illegal server. In other words, the State Department was trying to cover-up Hillary's crime of sending classified information on a server our enemies could easily access by trying to reverse the classification.\n\nThis is a criminal conspiracy - a conspiracy that included Hillary's deleting and bleaching of 33,000 emails, the disappearance of 13 phones, 2 boxes of email evidence gone missing, and the destruction of laptops in a secret deal with the FBI.\n\nRemember, also, that Hillary lied under oath to Congress saying she had never sent or received classified information on her insecure sever, and pretended not to know that the letter \"C\" meant confidential information that was classified. Hillary then told the FBI she couldn't remember 39 times, and then, in written testimony last week under oath, said she couldn't remember another 21 times.\n\nWe are witnessing a criminal enterprise that has turned our government into a vehicle for the Clinton's personal profit at your expense.\n\nBut it gets even worse.\n\nThe FBI documents show that Under-Secretary of State Patrick Kennedy made the request for altering classification as part of a \"quid pro quo.\" This is felony corruption. Under-Secretary Kennedy needs to resign.\n\nClinton cronies have sacrificed your security, your family's safety, and your country's safety as though it meant nothing at all.\n\nThis is magnitudes worse than Watergate. And we're going to put an end to it on November 8th.\n\nBut there's still more. Another series of emails shows top officials in the Clinton campaign scheming to take massive sums of money from foreign lobbyists. One of the emails from a top Hillary official said, quote, \"take the money!!\" with two exclamation points. This is money bundled by people registered as lobbyists on behalf of foreign governments.\n\nRemember, we are competing in a rigged election - the media is trying to rig the election by giving credence to false stories that have no validity and making it front page news, only to poison the minds of the American voters. The media is an extension of the Clinton Campaign, as WikiLeaks proved - Hillary even got the questions and answers in advance of a major debate.\n\nA new report from the Center for Public Integrity shows that 96% of so-called journalists and reporters who donated this cycle gave their money to Hillary Clinton. They even want to try and rig the election at the polling booths, where so many cities are corrupt and voter fraud is all too common.\n\nThe following comes straight from Pew Research.\n\nQUOTE: \"Approximately 24 million--one of every eight--voter registrations in the United States are no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate.\"\n\nQUOTE: \"More than 1.8 million deceased individuals are listed as voters.\"\n\nQUOTE: \"Approximately 2.75 million people have registrations in more than one state.\"\n\nThen there is the issue of illegal immigrants voting. The following comes from a 2014 report from the Washington Post. The article was entitled: \"could non-citizens decide the November election?\" Here are some excerpts.\n\nQUOTE: \"More than 14 percent of non-citizens in both the 2008 and 2010 samples indicated that they were registered to vote.\"\n\nQUOTE: \"Because non-citizens tended to favor Democrats (Obama won more than 80 percent of the votes of non-citizens in the 2008 sample), we find that this participation was large enough to plausibly account for Democratic victories in a few close elections. Non-citizen votes could have given Senate Democrats the pivotal 60th vote needed to overcome filibusters in order to pass health-care reform and other Obama administration priorities in the 111th Congress. It is also possible that non-citizen votes were responsible for Obama's 2008 victory in North Carolina. Obama won the state by 14,177 votes, so a turnout by 5.1 percent of North Carolina's adult non-citizens would have provided this victory margin.\"\n\nOur system is also rigged by the donors, giving hundreds of millions to Hillary Clinton's campaign.\n\nThe reason Hillary Clinton pushes for NAFTA, or the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and for completely open borders, is because her international donors control her every move.\n\nIf we let the Clinton Cartel run this government, history will record that 2017 was the year America lost its independence.\n\nWe will not let that happen.\n\nIt is time to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C.\n\nThat is why I am proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again.\n\nWhen Bill Clinton came into office, he signed an executive order saying if you work for the White House or a federal agency, you can't lobby the government for 5 years after you leave. But then, President Clinton did what the Clintons always do - he rigged the system on his way out. Clinton lifted the executive order so the Clintons and their cronies like John Podesta could start raking in cash.\n\nSo, here is what I am announcing tonight. First: I am going to re-institute a 5-year ban on all executive branch officials lobbying the government for 5 years after they leave government service. I am going to ask Congress to pass this ban into law so that it cannot be lifted by executive order.\n\nSecond: I am going to ask Congress to institute its own 5-year ban on lobbying by former members of Congress and their staffs.\n\nThird: I am going to expand the definition of lobbyist so we close all the loopholes that former government officials use by labeling themselves consultants and advisors when we all know they are lobbyists.\n\nFourth: I am going to issue a lifetime ban against senior executive branch officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government.\n\nAnd Fifth: I am going to ask Congress to pass a campaign finance reform that prevents registered foreign lobbyists from raising money in American elections.\n\nNot only will we end our government corruption, but we will end the economic stagnation.\n\nMy plan for the economy can be summed up in three simple words: jobs, jobs, jobs.\n\nAt the center of my plan will be fixing our terrible trade deals.\n\n47 million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are on Food Stamps.\n\nWe have nearly an $800 billion annual trade deficit in goods with the world, and the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.\n\nIt's the Clintons who gave us NAFTA, and the Clintons who gave us China's entry into the World Trade Organization.\n\nBriggs & Stratton has cut thousands of Wisconsin manufacturing jobs and moved them to China.\n\nGE Healthcare recently closed its Milwaukee location and shipped the jobs to Mexico.\n\nJohnson Controls shuttered its plants in Milwaukee and West Allis and moved the jobs to Mexico and China.\n\nThe list goes on and on.\n\nWe are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.\n\nA Trump Administration is going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to China, and stop the jobs from leaving our country.\n\nAs part of our plan to bring back our jobs, we are going to lower our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent.\n\nWe will be a rich nation once again.\n\nBut to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country.\n\nNational Security begins at the border.\n\nSpeaking in secret to a foreign bank Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally \"open trade and open borders.\"\n\nBy \"open trade,\" she means foreign countries can cheat us out of millions of jobs and trillions of dollars.\n\nBy \"open borders,\" she means totally unlimited immigration.\n\nIn a secret speech to Goldman Sachs, she said citizens who want to control immigration are \"Un-American.\"\n\nSo Hillary thinks most of the country is either deplorable, irredeemable, un-American, racist, or basement dwellers supporting Bernie Sanders.\n\nHillary's plan includes an open border with the Middle East - meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within our shores.\n\nSo let me state this as clearly as I can. If I'm elected President I am going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country.\n\nWe will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration.\n\nA Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders. And yes, we will build a wall.\n\nWe have the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers.\n\nAs Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be released because their home countries wouldn't take them back.\n\nThe ICE officers described Hillary's proposal as, quote, the most radical immigration proposal in U.S. history.\" Here is a summary of the Hillary plan:\n\n--Support for Sanctuary Cities\n\n--Social Security, Medicare and lifetime welfare for illegal immigrants by making them all citizens\n\n--Obamacare for illegal immigrants\n\n--No deportation of visa overstays\n\n--Expanding catch-and-release on the border\n\n--Expanding President Obama's unconstitutional executive amnesty, including instant work permits for millions of illegal workers\n\n--Freeing even more criminal aliens by expanding Obama's non-enforcement directives\n\n--A 550% increase in Syrian refugees\n\nEither we win this election, or we lose the country.\n\nUnder a Trump Administration, it's going to be America First.\n\nHere are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:\n\nWe are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; defend religious liberty; provide school choice to every low-income child in America; rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; support the men and women of law enforcement; repeal and replace Obamacare; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\n\nYou have 22 days to make every dream you ever dreamed of for your country come true.\n\nOn November 8th, the arrogance of Washington D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.\n\nI am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation.\n\nI'm going to fight for every child living in poverty. I'm going to fight for every mom who lost her child to illegal immigration, and drugs and gang violence.\n\nI'm going to fight for every community whose jobs and dreams have been ripped out and shipped to other countries.\n\nI'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people - not the donors.\n\nAnd I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.\n\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\n\nYou're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this day. This is a movement like you've never seen before. You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote you've ever cast for anyone at any time.\n\nOnce again, we are going to have a government of, by and for the people.\n\nWe Will Make America Wealthy Again.\n\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\n\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\n\nAnd We Will Make America Great Again.\u0000","54":"Thank you. It's wonderful to be here in Virginia, a state where I have so many great friends and wonderful employees.\n\nTremendous polls keep coming in. A brand new Rasmussen poll has us up 5 points nationwide.\n\nOn November 8th, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House.\n\nWe are going to take on the big donors, and big business, and big media - we are going to take on the rigged system that has shipped America's wealth to other countries.\n\nWe are going to replace our failed and corrupt establishment with a new government that serves you, your family, and your country.\n\nMy economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs.\n\nWe will cut taxes for all working and middle-class households in America.\n\nWe will reduce regulations, which will put more money into the hands of our poorest workers and bring thousands of new companies to our shores.\n\nWe will unleash American energy, creating millions of new jobs and lowering energy costs. The Obama-Clinton energy restrictions are nothing more than a massive tax on the poor - we will remove those restrictions day one.\n\nWe will repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare.\n\nPresident Obama promised his plan would reduce premiums by $2,500 dollars. Instead, they surged $5,000.\n\nOur replacement plan includes expanded access to Healthcare Savings Accounts, with support for those who need it. It includes allowing Americans to buy health insurance across state lines in all 50 states, creating a dynamic and competitive new market - they will be competing for your business.\n\nWe're also going to block grant Medicaid so states can develop innovative solutions to make sure no citizen in poverty ever falls through the cracks. High-risk pools will also help to ensure that those with pre-existing conditions will always get the quality coverage they need.\n\nOn trade, we are going to end the international abuse, the foreign cheating, and the one-sided rules that govern NAFTA and the World Trade Organization. Right now, America eliminates its tariffs, but then other countries tax our goods with backdoor tariffs and close their markets.\n\nOur massive, chronic trade deficits are destroying the middle class - and shifting money away from workers to large corporations who have no borders. There's a reason hedge funds and Wall Street are giving tens of millions to my opponent.\n\nHillary Clinton is the voice for the global special interests.\n\nI am running to be the voice of the forgotten men and women.\n\nMy opponent likes to say that for decades, she has been \"fighting for women.\" That she has been \"fighting for children.\"\n\nWhy then are 70 million American women and children living in poverty, or on the brink of poverty? Why has she provided no relief for the millions of Americans in search of affordable, reliable quality childcare? You know the old saying, \"Watch what I do, not what I say.\"\n\nAt the Trump Organization, and in my campaign for President, women occupy some of the highest positions. I have employed thousands of women in my company. Women of different backgrounds. Women of many talents.\n\nAnd just last week, joined by my daughter, Ivanka, I laid out my plan for childcare and eldercare. That plan has many great features, including tax-free childcare savings accounts. Low-income parents are given tax credits they can put straight into those accounts, and then get a $500 dollar per child match for those savings accounts deposits.\n\nFamilies can also deduct the cost of childcare from their taxes, a huge tax cut for the middle class.\n\nWe have also talked about improving education. My plan includes school choice for every disadvantaged child in America.\n\nWe are also going to bring down the cost of college.\n\nUniversities get massive federal funds, and huge tax breaks for their endowments - but then they don't spend those funds or those endowments on their students. I will work with Congress to make sure these special federal benefits are not available unless universities begin to reduce tuition and student debt. This will get to the problem at the source, and reduce both the cost for students and the cost for taxpayers. Our students are drowning and we're going to fix it.\n\nWomen also value security. They want a Commander-in-Chief that will defeat radical Islamic terrorism, stop the massive inflow of refugees, protect our borders, and who will reduce the rising crime and violence in our cities.\n\nAs I campaign across this country, I hear so many stories and pleas, from women especially, about drug addiction and opioid use. They are doing their best in their communities and for their families to provide a safe and nurturing environment.\n\nBut even the best-laid plans cannot always protect our youth, and increasingly, many adults, from the scourge of drugs. We lose thousands of our fellow Americans every year to opioid use. I will stop the drug inflow from our borders. These drugs come over the border and make their way into our urban and rural communities, and into our suburbs.\n\nThis must change. Every change starts with a conversation. Together, we will have this conversation. And we will make this change.\n\nThe changes will start immediately.\n\nHere, in Virginia, we are going to end the war on American energy. Hillary Clinton says she wants to put the miners out of work. Clinton and Kaine also want to shut down shale, and shut down natural gas. The Clinton regulatory agenda will drive up electricity prices for Virginia families and will cost the U.S. economy over $5 trillion.\n\nBy the way, less than a week after taking office, Tim Kaine proposed a $4 billion dollar tax hike in Virginia, including on people earning as little as $17,000 dollars a year.\n\nWe are going to open up all sources of American energy and bring jobs, wealth, and cheaper electricity to Virginia.\n\nAnother major part of our agenda is safety.\n\nI believe every family in America is entitled to live in safety and peace.\n\nToday, the nation just opened the Smithsonian National Museum of African-American History and Culture. We congratulate and honor those involved with the project, and recognize today the incredible contributions of the African-American community to this nation.\n\nAfrican-Americans have given so much to this nation and sacrificed so much for this nation.\n\nMany African-Americans are succeeding so greatly in our country, and I will make sure their success is protected and supported.\n\nAt the same time, too many African-Americans have been left behind and trapped in poverty.\n\nI will fight to make sure every single African-American child in this country is fully included in the American Dream.\n\nThat includes the new civil rights issue of our time: School Choice.\n\nDemocrats have run the inner cities for half a century or more, and produced only more joblessness and poverty.\n\nThe jobs are leaving, the schools are failing, and crime is rising.\n\nTo those suffering, I say: Vote for Donald Trump. What do you have to lose? I will fix it. I will fight harder for you than anyone has before.\n\nThe policies of Hillary Clinton have brought only suffering in our inner cities - just like her bad judgment overseas unleashed suffering everywhere she went.\n\nOf course, she got rich through it all - the Clintons made another $60 million in gross income while she was Secretary of State.\n\nWorst of all, she put her public office up for sale - and then bleached her emails, and destroyed her phones, to try to cover her tracks following a congressional subpoena.\n\nThere's a reason the hedge fund managers are donating to Hillary Clinton's campaign - and not mine. Everybody getting rich off the rigged system, and who wants nothing to change, are throwing their money at Hillary Clinton.\n\nMy campaign is powered by my own money, and by small dollar donations from everyday patriotic citizens.\n\n95% of our donors are small dollar donations. Every dollar helps us deliver your country back to you.\n\nOur campaign is about breaking up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We're trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives. They're all part of the same political establishment.\n\nThey go to the same restaurants, they attend the same conferences, they have the same friends and connections. They all support the same ideology of globalism that makes them rich while shipping your jobs, your factories, and your wealth to other countries.\n\nI am not running to be President of the World. I am running to be President of the United States. I Am For America - and America First.\n\nTogether, we will rebuild this country beyond our greatest dreams.\n\nGovernment will start working again. Fixing things is what I do. Just look at my projects in New York, where I turned rundown spaces into new centers of business, activity and opportunity - where others saw only problems, I saw only potential.\n\nWe turned empty lots into homes, offices and living memories for thousands of workers and families.\n\nThat's what I want to do for our country - I want to go into the neglected neighborhoods, the failing schools, the forgotten stretches of this nation, and unlock their potential for all of our people.\n\nI've made a living for years looking at unused spaces and imagining what they could be. Politicians look at blighted neighborhoods and offer only excuses - I look at those same neighborhoods and offer solutions.\n\nWe spend so much time thinking about how things used to be, we've stopped thinking about how great things could be - all we have to do is tune out the doubters, the cynics, and the naysayers.\n\nWe are a nation of strivers, dreamers, and believers - and that's the spirit that will carry us to victory in November, and to great victories as a nation.\n\nIt's that same spirit of resilience I have seen visiting the flood-ravaged towns in Louisiana, or meeting with the incredible but hard-hit people in cities and towns like Flint, Michigan.\n\nIt used to be the cars were made in Flint, and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico. Today, cars are made in Mexico, and you can't drink the water in Flint. We'll turn it all around.\n\nBut that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th.\n\nYou have to knock on doors. You have to pick up that phone. Go to our website to learn more. You have to campaign on the streets. Spread the love that we have in this room to the people of our country. To beat the system, you have to lift your voice, pound the pavement, and get out the vote.\n\nYou have 44 days until the big vote. You have 44 days to make possible every dream you ever dreamed of for your country.\n\nYou have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman, and child in this nation.\n\nThe arrogance of Washington, D.C. will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.\n\nThis November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is Back - Bigger and Better and Stronger than Ever Before.\n\nHere is just some of what will happen starting in January of 2017:\n\nI am going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; unleash American energy; end illegal immigration - and yes we will build the wall ; save the 2nd amendment, and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\n\nWe will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools, and hospitals.\n\nAmerican cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.\n\nAmerican steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.\n\nAnd we will put our great miners and steelworkers back to work.\n\nAmerican hands will rebuild this nation - and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.\n\nWe will put new American steel into the spine of this country.\n\nI will fight for every neglected part of this nation - and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.\n\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\n\nIt is time to break with the bitter failures of the past and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.\n\nHillary Clinton has a 3-word campaign pledge. It reads: \"I'm With Her.\"\n\nI have a different pledge: I'm With You - the American People.\n\nTo all of our people, in all of our cities and towns, I say these words to you tonight: I'm with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you.\n\nOnce more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.\n\nWe Will Make America Wealthy Again.\n\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\n\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\n\nAnd We Will Make America Great Again.\n\nThank you, and God Bless!\u0000","55":"This is such an amazing city. It's called \"Home of the Heroes,\" because of your proud tradition of military service. Pueblo is home to Four Medal of Honor Recipients. As President Eisenhower said, there must be \"something in the water out there in Pueblo\" because \"all you guys turn out to be heroes.\"\nColorado is home to six military bases. We are going to eliminate the defense sequester and rebuild our military.\n\nAnother great Colorado legacy is hunting and fishing. We are going to conserve your land for future generations, and we are going to save the 2nd amendment.\n\nOne other issue of such great importance in Colorado is energy. Hillary Clinton wants to shut down the mines, and shut down shale, oil, and natural gas. We are going to end the war on American energy, and we are going to put the miners back to work.\n\nI have also made a center piece of my economic revitalization plan the largest middle class tax cut since Ronald Reagan -and the largest regulatory reform in American history. That is because I know how overtaxed and overregulated the working people of this country are.\n\nA central issue I would like to address today is our broken tax code, an issue of concern to all Americans.\n\nAlong with securing our borders, rebuilding our military, keeping us safe from terrorism, redoing our trade deals and bringing back jobs, fixing the tax code is one of the main reasons I'm running for President.\n\nI've been saying from the beginning of this campaign how ridiculous, complex and yes, unfair, our tax system is. This is not the fault of the IRS, but the political class that is owned outright by the special interests and lobbyists.\n\nIt is these politicians who wrote the tax code, and who are constantly adding, revising, and changing, an already over-complicated set of laws - all at the behest of their favored donors and special interests.\n\nIt's thousands of pages long, and almost no one understands it. The average American would need an army of accountants and lawyers to wade their way through it.\n\nMany so-called experts, due to the sheer size and complexity of the code, don't have a clue what these pages represent.\n\nThe unfairness of the tax laws is unbelievable, it's something I've been talking about for a long time - despite being a beneficiary.\n\nI understand the tax laws better than almost anyone, which is why I am the one who can fix them - and that is what I commit to doing.\n\nAs a businessman and real estate developer, I have legally used the tax laws to my benefit, and to the benefit of my company and my employees.\n\nI have often said on the campaign trail, that I have a fiduciary responsibility to pay no more tax than legally required - or, put another way, to pay as little tax as legally possible.\n\nAs a major real estate developer in this country, and throughout the world, I face enormous taxes: city taxes, state taxes, sales and excise taxes, employee taxes, and federal taxes. It's my job to minimize the overall tax burden to the greatest extent possible - which allows me to reinvest in neighborhoods, workers, and build amazing properties which fuel tremendous growth in their communities - and always help our great providers of jobs, the small business.\n\nThe news media is now obsessed with an alleged tax filing from the 1990's, at the end of one of the most brutal economic downturns in our country's history.\n\nThe conditions facing real estate developers in the early nineties were almost as bad as the Great Depression of 1929 and far worse than the Great Recession of 2008.\n\nWhat had been a booming economy in the era of Ronald Reagan changed dramatically - and the business landscape changed with it: Bank failures, the collapse of the Savings & Loan industry, and the implosion of the retail market, and real estate in general.\n\nMany business people, including many of my competitors, were not able to survive. Companies, jobs, and opportunities were lost - and lives were destroyed, as tens of thousands of people were put out of work. Some of the biggest and strongest people and companies went bankrupt.\n\nYet today, my company is bigger, stronger, with far greater assets, and more premium properties, than ever before.\n\nThat did not happen by chance or luck - it happened by action, and talent.\n\nI was able to use the tax laws of this country, and my business acumen, to dig out of this real estate depression when few others did. In those most difficult times, when so many had their backs to the wall, I reached within myself and delivered for my company, my employees, my family and the communities where my properties existed.\n\nThose who spend their entire lives within the confines of government work, and who know virtually nothing of business, fail to understand the skill, dedication, and sheer grit it takes for a company to climb out of an economic depression of the scale we had in the early nineties. People like my opponent Hillary Clinton, whose only method of making money is by selling\n\ngovernment favors and granting access to special interests, know nothing about how businesses succeed and grow. Hillary Clinton has never created a single job in her entire life - or added a single dollar of value to the American economy. Hillary Clinton hasn't made an honest dollar in her entire life - all she does is take from you, from our country, and peddles influence to donors, special interests, and foreign actors - for astronomical dollars and like never before. It's corruption of the highest order.\n\nWhile I made my money as a highly-successful private businessman following the law, Hillary Clinton made her money as a corrupt public official breaking the law and putting her government office up for sale.\n\nBy her own account, Hillary Clinton left the White House dead broke, and now she and her husband have made more than $200 million dollars - without building a company, or creating a single thing of value.\n\nDuring the early nineties, as companies were collapsing left and right, the media and powers that be said Donald Trump could never make it back. They said I had billions of dollars in borrowing, and hundreds of millions in personal guarantees, and no pathway out.\n\nBut, I never had any doubts and never gave up.\n\nThat's because I knew in my heart that when the chips are down is when I perform at my very best. And when people make the mistake of underestimating me, that's when they are in for their biggest surprise.\n\nJust look at what happened in the primary. Just look at what our incredible movement is doing right now.\n\nThe reason I never felt endangered during the real estate downturn, was that I knew myself, I knew my business, I knew the financial system, I knew the tax code and, most importantly, I knew how to fight. That's what I am - a fighter, and I am now going to fight for you.\n\nWith my knowledge, I knew that I would make a comeback in business.\n\nThat is why I am here today. That is why I have left private business for public life - because I understand our country is in very bad shape. And now our country is in need of a major comeback - it needs one now more than ever.\n\nWe owe $20 trillion dollars in debt, but that's only part of the story - we have over $100 trillion dollars in unfunded liabilities, and we have a budget that's out of control with annual deficits. In addition, because of the incompetence of our leaders, we run massive trade deficits on an annual basis, now almost $800 billion a year.\n\nOur country is broke.\n\nWe have decaying infrastructure, failing schools, rising crime, a depleted military, an open border, and an economy that can't create full-time high-paying jobs. We are a divided nation, and each week it seems we are getting more and more divided, with race riots in our streets on a monthly basis.\n\nThis is not the America that was handed down to us, and it's not the America we want for our children. And it's certainly not the America we want to pass down to our grandchildren. But this is the America we will have if we don't turn things around - starting today.\n\nWhat I say is not lost on the American people, because 70% of you believe our country is headed in the wrong direction.\n\nWe cannot have another 4 years of Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton will be worse.\n\nWe can turn this all around - but not if we don't make a change in leadership RIGHT NOW. The failed political establishment must go - it must go for the sake of your country, your future, and those you love the most.\n\nIn the early 90's, they splashed the front pages with stories about how I was finished. Everybody said that I was done - there were front page articles in the Wall Street Journal and New York Times. They were thrilled and delighted to write these negative stories.\n\nSo they said I was finished. The only person who didn't think that I was in trouble was Donald Trump.\n\nI started my company with a small loan and, as I grew, I borrowed money to grow the company. When the bottom fell out of the Real Estate market, I had all the debt, it stayed the same - but the value of the assets plummeted. But I knew how to use the tax code to rebuild my company when others did not.\n\nMy understanding of the tax code gave me a big advantage over those who didn't have a clue, including many of my competitors who lost everything they had, never to be heard from again.\n\nNow, they're gone, and I'm here and I'm ready to turn things around for this country.\n\nThe early 90's was a very tough time for the world, but in tough times you need tough people.\n\nThese are tough times for America today, and we need tough leaders. Not people who tell you what you want to hear, but people who tell you what you need to hear: we must never allow corrupt career politicians, like the Clintons, ever back into the White House again.\n\nThese tough times were when I performed my very best. The economy and banks collapsing, the government was a mess - but I enjoyed waking up every day to go to battle. I enjoyed getting up every morning to take on the financial establishment on behalf of my company and win. That's the thinking we need for our country - that's the thinking we need when we are negotiating trade deals, and military deals, and economic deals on behalf of the American people.\n\nPut me into the boardroom as YOUR representative, and I will deliver for you. Hillary Clinton is in it only for herself and her donors. I am here fighting for America.\n\nMany people have said that I perform better under pressure than anyone they've ever seen - I've proven that over and over again.\n\nThat's what I do. When the pressure is on, when the odds are stacked against me, when people say it can't be done - that's when I am just getting started.\n\nThe thing that motivates me the most is when people tell me something is impossible. For me, impossible is just a starting point.\n\nFrom the depths of that terrible real estate depression, I created a company worth billions and billions of dollars and created tens of thousands of jobs. Our company, and our employees, remade skylines, revitalized neighborhoods, rejuvenated communities, and hired thousands of workers.\n\nOn November 8th, America's comeback begins - and we are going to rise up from our present challenges bigger and better and stronger than ever before.\n\nThe people here in Pueblo know what it takes to rebuild this country.\n\nThis is a city with a rich immigrant history, and a rich Latino history, that has contributed so much to this country and this state. Though the people of Pueblo, and their families, have hailed from all regions of the world, you are united by this one thing: You are all Americans.\n\nAnd, as Americans, you are entitled to the same protections as every other American. Everyone lawfully living inside of our borders are entitled to the same things: safe communities, a great education, and access to high-paying jobs.\n\nThis is the change I will deliver. Hillary Clinton has been there for 30 years and delivered nothing but failure. Her policies have brought death and destruction overseas, and poverty at home. She's brought massive poverty for everyone, but especially African-American and Hispanic Citizens.\n\nShe opposes school choice, and wants to trap poor African-American and Hispanic children in failing government schools. We are going to get poor minority children out of failing schools and into the public, private, charter or magnet school of their choice.\n\nHillary Clinton supports Obamacare, and wants to expand it - Obamacare is an absolute disaster. Premiums in Colorado are set to go up another 20 percent - the only way to stop this disaster is to vote Trump.\n\nHillary Clinton also supports the terrible trade deals, like Bill Clinton's NAFTA and China's entry into the World Trade Organization - and next she wants the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the deal she calls the \"Gold Standard.\"\n\nColorado has lost more than 1 in 7 manufacturing jobs since the NAFTA and China deals.\n\nBut while you've lost out, Hillary Clinton has raked in cash from her contributors. She and Bill have made $150 million in speeches to special interests. They gave 39 speeches to Big Banks, including $2 million in speaking fees from Goldman Sachs. The Clintons received another $2 million from a Swiss Bank after Hillary negotiated a favorable settlement for them as Secretary of State.\n\nTo hide her corruption, Hillary Clinton put her emails on an illegal secret server open to foreign hacking. Then she deleted and bleached 33,000 emails - after a congressional subpoena -- to hide them from the public. She lies to Congress, under oath, and her ringleaders took the fifth amendment and got immunity deals. It's worse than Watergate.\n\nThe investigation of Hillary Clinton was rigged, and it's a shame, and it's one of the saddest things that have ever taken place in our nation.\n\nWe have become a Banana Republic.\n\nNow, today, we learned, that the FBI made a side deal with Clinton's top aides to DESTROY their laptops.\n\nLet me repeat that: the FBI reportedly made a deal to DESTROY the laptops of government officials implicated in a massive criminal cover-up.\n\nHillary Clinton is the ringleader of a criminal enterprise that has corrupted our government at the highest levels, and the American people have one chance to stop it - by showing up and voting on November 8th.\n\nPeople have had it with the years, the decades of Clinton Corruption.\n\nThis is the year the American people say: Enough is Enough.\n\nThe Clintons are the sordid past. We are the bright future.\n\nNow, another issue I want to address today is immigration. As I mentioned, Pueblo is filled with wonderful hardworking immigrants. It is these hardworking immigrants who stand to lose the most from our open borders immigration policy.\n\nIllegal immigration, and broken visa programs, take jobs directly from Hispanic workers living here lawfully today.\n\nIllegal immigration also brings with it massive crime, and massive drugs - including a terrible heroin problem right here in Colorado.\n\nWe are going to build a border wall, and we are going to stop the drugs, gangs and the violence from pouring into Colorado.\n\nWe are going to shut down the Sanctuary Cities that have led to the preventable deaths of so many.\n\nCases like Kate Steinle, murdered in San Francisco by a 5-time deported illegal immigrant.\n\nOr cases like Sarah Root, killed by an illegal immigrant released at the border by President Obama - and then released again after the killing.\n\nThere are over 2 million criminal aliens in this county, and we are going to get them out - and we are going to get them out quickly.\n\nTo the cartels, the gangs, the drug dealers, I have a simple message for you: your days are numbered, and your reign of crime will soon come crashing to an end.\n\nWe also have to keep our country safe from terrorism. The terrorists who planted the bombs in New York and Jersey, and who carried out the mall stabbing in Minnesota, were foreign nationals admitted into our country - as was the mall shooter in Washington.\n\nOr look at cases like the Boston Bombers, here on asylum, or the San Bernardino Shooter, here on a fiance visa from Saudi Arabia. Or the Orlando shooter, the son of a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan.\n\nTerrorists are infiltrating our country.\n\nNow, Hillary Clinton wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees and countless more refugees\n\nfrom across the Middle East.\n\nI want to keep you and your family safe.\n\nMy job is not to represent foreign countries. My job is to represent the citizens of the United States of America - putting your jobs, your wages, and your security first.\n\nIf you are living in the United States today as a lawful resident or U.S. citizen, I will ensure you have a safe community, rising wages, and secure immigration system.\n\nImmigration Security is National Security.\n\nHere are some more things we will do starting in 2017 -\n\nWe are going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; make childcare more affordable; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\n\nWe are going to rebuild America.\n\nWe are going to revitalize America.\n\nAnd we are going to unite America.\n\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\n\nTogether, we will make America wealthy again.\n\nWe will make America strong again.\n\nWe will make America safe again.\n\nAnd we will make America great again.\n\nThank you, and God Bless!\u0000","56":"This is our chance - our one chance - to fix our rigged system and create prosperity for each and every American.\nOur vision of hope stands in stark contrast to my opponent's campaign of hate.\n\nHillary Clinton has been running a hate-filled and negative campaign with no policy, no solutions, and no new ideas.\n\nBy contrast, I've been going around the country offering detailed plans for reform.\n\nAll of these reform plans are available on our website.\n\nWhile my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable, I call you hardworking American patriots who love your country and want a better future for all of our people.\n\nYou are mothers and fathers, soldiers and sailors, carpenters and welders. You are Democrats, Independents and Republicans.\n\nAbove all else, you are Americans - and you are entitled to leadership that honors you, cherishes you and defends you.\n\nEvery American is entitled to be treated with dignity and respect in our country.\n\nWhether you vote for me, or whether you vote for someone else, I will be your champion in the White House.\n\nHillary Clinton represents only the insiders, the donors and the special interests.\n\nI will be speaking more about Hillary Clinton's disqualifying remarks in a minute, but first let me invite onto the stage some people who can tell you themselves what they think of her spiteful comments.\n\nI have some more thoughts on Clinton's remarks I will be sharing momentarily, but first I want to tell you what I am going to do to make your life better.\n\nWe've outlined a detailed plan on trade, on immigration, on rebuilding the military, on changing our foreign policy.\n\nI've delivered a plan on defeating Islamic terrorism, on reforming our tax code, on unleashing American energy, and on providing school choice to every disadvantaged child in America.\n\nWe've released policy after policy, solution after solution.\n\nEvery day, we are putting forward new ideas to make your life better.\n\nThe change will start right away, the moment I take my oath of office.\n\nOn my first day, we are going to immediately terminate every single unconstitutional executive order signed by President Obama.\n\nThen, I am going to order a review of every single regulation issued over the last eight\n\nyears. All needless, job-killing regulations will be cancelled. Millions of new jobs will come pouring in.\n\nWe are going to lift the restriction on American energy - this will create another half a million new jobs a year.\n\nThat's just the beginning.\n\nOn my first day in office, I am going to ask Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare - this will instantly save another 2 million jobs.\n\nI am also going to propose a massive tax reduction to unleash prosperity in every city and state in our country.\n\nOn that first day, I am also going to instruct the Department of Commerce to immediately begin a review of all foreign trade practices that unfairly hurt American manufacturing. I will use every lawful Presidential power to achieve relief for our workers.\n\nYou can read the full 7-point trade plan on my website, DonaldJTrump.com.\n\nNorth Carolina has lost more than 4 in 10 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA. Bill Clinton signed it, and Hillary Clinton supported it.\n\nRight here in Ashville, you've lost 1 in 5 manufacturing jobs since China joined the World Trade Organization - another Hillary-backed deal.\n\nHillary Clinton owes all of you an apology. And I think you'll get that apology right around the same time Hillary Clinton hands over the 33,000 emails she deleted.\n\nBy the way, Hillary Clinton destroyed her emails after she received a congressional subpoena. They used a special software called bleach bit.\n\nShe even made her 13 different phones disappear - some of them were even destroyed with a hammer.\n\nHillary Clinton obviously had a whole lot to hide, including her pay-for-play scandals at Secretary of State.\n\nPay-for-play with UBS, with Russian Uranium, with contracts for her friends and family\n\nin Haiti.\n\nNothing is so dangerous to American Democracy as when a public official puts their federal office up for sale.\n\nHillary Clinton believes she is above the law.\n\nShe also believes that she is above all of you.\n\nAfter months of hiding from the press, Hillary Clinton came out and finally told the world how she feels about the people of this country.\n\nShe said tens of millions of patriotic Americans belong in a \"basket of deplorables.\" She talks about people like they're objects, not human beings.\n\nShe said half of our supporters are not even real Americans, and describes the other half as having run out of options - what she can't understand or accept is that the great majority of this country now sees right through the lies and deceptions of a failed political establishment. They want change, they want justice, and they want a government that puts the American people first.\n\nWhether our supporters have lost a job to a factory moved to another country, or whether they're a captain in the police department, or a teacher at a local school, they are united by their deep and sophisticated understanding of how our political system has abandoned the people.\n\nFor those who have been hit by hard times, they understand better than anyone that it's Hillary Clinton's Wall Street agenda that has crushed the middle class of this country.\n\nHillary Clinton spoke with hatred in her heart for these working class Americans. She looks down on them - she looks down on all the people who make her life possible. She looks down on the carpenters, plumbers, electricians, lawyers and accountants. She looks down on the police officers, soldiers, and firefighters supporting our campaign.\n\nShe looks down on the people who cook her meals, drive her cars, and dig the coal that powers her electricity.\n\nShe called these Americans every name in the book - racist, sexist, xenophobic, Islamophobic - she said they were not even American.\n\nNever in history has a major-party presidential candidate so viciously demonized the American voter.\n\nShe was attacking millions of moms and dads who love their children and want a better future for all Americans.\n\nWhat should these parents tell their children about Hillary Clinton's attacks?\n\nTo every kid in America tonight, I want you to know: your parents are working so hard to make your life better, and to make your country better - and if I get the chance, I will fight right alongside them to deliver a better future for everyone.\n\nClinton made her remarks at a high-dollar fundraiser in Wall Street. Her goal is simple: to bully the American voter out of voting for change.\n\nThe people who rigged the system want to keep things exactly as they are. They want to keep our terrible trade deals. They want to trap children in failing government schools. They want massive regulation to keep small businesses from being able to compete.\n\nHillary Clinton can never be President of this country. No one who has such a low opinion of the American people can ever be elected as their President.\n\nEarlier today I had a chance to spend some time with some more of our most amazing Americans.\n\nI spent the afternoon with the National Guard Association of the United States.\n\nThese are the heroes who rescue our people in disasters, and who fight our wars.\n\nThese heroes are a permanent testament to the courage and character of our nation.\n\nWe also honor and remember the lives of the service members who have made the ultimate sacrifice.\n\nThere is no greater love than the love shown by the men and women who have laid down their lives for this country and its people.\n\nOur debt to them is eternal and everlasting.\n\nOne thing that we must do is to ensure that our men and women in uniform have the best equipment, resources and tools in the world.\n\nWe must provide them the best medical care while they serve, and the best medical care when they return home to civilian life.\n\nThe Veterans scandals that have occurred under this Administration - and that have been dismissed by my opponent - are a permanent stain on this government. It's just one more way Hillary Clinton only looks out for herself.\n\nWe must take care of our Veterans. That includes giving Veterans the right to choose treatment at either a public VA facility, or the private doctor of their choice.\n\nJust today we learned that the VA has violated a federal law by failing to make its\n\nperformance records available to consumers.\n\nThe scandals never seem to end - but they will, when I'm elected President.\n\nNothing makes me more proud than to have the support of the men and women who hear the uniform.\n\nWe've received endorsements from 120 generals and admirals, these are the people who know how to keep our country safe.\n\nJust today, I was profoundly humbled to gain the endorsement of 13 Medal of Honor recipients. I can't even begin to say how much it means to me to have the support of these intrepid heroes.\n\nAlso, today, I was thrilled to announce that Ambassador R. James Woolsey, former head of the CIA, is now a senior advisor to our campaign.\n\nWe are on a mission of change.\n\nThat includes a new agenda for our inner cities.\n\nThe Democratic Party has run the inner cities for fifty, sixty, seventy years and more.\n\n4 in 10 African-American children live in poverty, including 45% of those under the age of six.\n\n2,900 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.\n\nFor those suffering and hurting, I say: give Donald J. Trump a chance. I will fix it. What do you have to lose?\n\nLet me also tell you what you have to gain: millions of new jobs, higher wages, and amazing schools.\n\nI will fight for Detroit, for Chicago, for Baltimore, and for every neglected part of this nation - and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.\n\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\n\nIt is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a New American Future.\n\nIn this future, we will respect the dignity of all Americans - and that means great jobs, great schools, and great neighborhoods.\n\nWe will keep our children safe - which includes steadfast support for American law enforcement.\n\nJobs will return, prosperity will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores.\n\nGovernment corruption will end.\n\nHonesty will be restored.\n\nRepublicans are the Party of Abraham Lincoln and, come November 8th, we will once again have a government of, by and for the people.\n\nWe will make America prosperous again.\n\nWe will make America safe again.\n\nAnd will Make America great again.\n\nThank you, and God Bless!\u0000","57":"Thank you. It is so great to be in my second home, Florida, and in the city of Miami where I have so many wonderful friends and employees.\nNew polls have just come in, and we're leading in battleground states all over this country - including four points here in Florida. LA Times has us up 6 points nationwide.\n\nCome November 8th, we are going to win Florida and we are going to win the White House.\n\nIt's going to be a victory for the people - it's going to be a victory for the workers, the families, the Veterans, the everyday citizens.\n\nAnd it's going to be a victory for those who haven't had reason for hope in a long time.\n\nI'm campaigning in every community, and every part of this country, for every last vote. I am running to be a President for all Americans.\n\nI just had the most amazing afternoon in Little Haiti and I'm going to be campaigning hard for their votes. What incredible people.\n\nOur support comes from all regions, all backgrounds and all walks of life. You are cops and soldiers, carpenters and welders, accountants and lawyers, young and old, rich and poor, black, white and Hispanic - but above all else, you are American.\n\nJust today, I was honored to get the endorsement of recipients of the Medal of Honor and many of our amazing military leaders. We now have the endorsements of more than 160 top generals and Admirals.\n\nWe also have the support of 16,500 Border Patrol Officers - as well as law enforcement officers across the country.\n\nAnd we have the support of millions of patriotic Moms and Dads who go to work every day and make this country run.\n\nWhile my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable, I call you hardworking American patriots who love your family and love your country.\n\nClinton's campaign relies on the tired tactic of smearing opponents who question her policies as racists. It's the oldest play in the Democratic play book - and Americans have had enough.\n\nThey want solutions, and they want better lives - not more petty attacks from failed and discredited politicians.\n\nPeople who want their immigration laws enforced, and their borders secured, are not racists. They are patriotic Americans of all backgrounds who want their jobs and families protected.\n\nPeople who warn about Radical Islamic Terrorism are not Islamophobes. They are decent American citizens who want to uphold our tolerant values and keep our country safe.\n\nPeople who support the police, and who want crime reduced, are not prejudiced. They are concerned and loving citizens whose hearts break every time an innocent child is lost to preventable violence.\n\nYet, while she lives behind gates and walls and guards, and raises millions from hedge fund managers and Wall Street donors, she slanders and smears working people who just want a fraction of the security enjoyed by our politicians.\n\nHer comments displayed the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as Secretary of State, hide and delete her emails, destroy her phones with a hammer, put classified information in the reach of our enemies, lie to Congress, and sell government favors and access through the Clinton Foundation.\n\nIt's the same attitude of arrogance and entitlement that explains why she has never taken accountability for the disasters she created in Libya, Syria, Iraq, Iran and all over the world. It's the same reason why she won't take responsibility for her central role in unleashing ISIS.\n\nHer policies have created disaster overseas, and poverty at home. I am running to reverse these failures, and create a New American future.\n\nThat future begins with prosperity at home.\n\nMy economic agenda can be summed up in three words: jobs, jobs, jobs.\n\nOne of my highest priorities is to bring jobs into our inner cities. African-Americans communities have suffered horribly as a result of failed Democratic leadership.\n\nDemocrats have run these inner cities for half a century. They control the mayors' offices, the school boards, the city councils, and the seats in Congress - and all they have delivered is more poverty, more crime, and more failing schools.\n\n45% of African-American children under the age of 6 now live in poverty. More than 3,000 have been shot in Chicago this year alone. 58% of African-American youth are not working.\n\nThese are the results of the policies embraced by Hillary Clinton, and everyone knows that if she's elected the inner cities will get nothing but more pain and more suffering.\n\nHillary Clinton has been there in Washington for 30 years - her disastrous record speaks for itself.\n\nThe only people she delivers for is her donors.\n\nI am going to deliver for you, the American people.\n\nIf we lower our taxes, remove destructive regulations, unleash the vast treasure of American energy, and negotiate trade deals that put America First, then there is no limit to the number of jobs we can create and the amount of prosperity we can unleash.\n\nMy first day in office, I am going to order a review of every single regulation issued over the last eight years. All needless, job-killing regulations will be cancelled. Millions of new jobs will come pouring in.\n\nWe are going to lift the restrictions on American energy - which means at least another half a million new jobs a year.\n\nThat's just the beginning.\n\nAlso on my first day, I am going to ask Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare - this will instantly save another 2 million jobs.\n\nI am also going to completely reform our trade deals. We are going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to China, and keep America out of the TPP. We don't need another massive multinational deal that ties us up and binds us down.\n\nAnother major reform is going to be school choice. I've outlined a plan to provide every disadvantaged child in America the freedom to choose the private, public, magnet or religious school of his or her choice.\n\nThis will help lift millions of poor African-American and Hispanic children out of poverty.\n\nSince President Obama came into office, another 2 million Hispanic-Americans have fallen into poverty. This is unacceptable. To the Hispanic community I say: we are going to protect your jobs, we are going to build up your schools, and we are going to deliver safety and opportunity for your children.\n\nEarlier this week, I also rolled out a plan to help our mothers and our families get affordable, quality childcare for their children.\n\nOn policy after policy, we are going to provide opportunity, prosperity and security for all Americans.\n\nWe are also going to stand with the Cuban people in their fight against communist oppression.\n\nThe President's one-sided deal for Cuba benefits only the Castro Regime. But all of the concessions that Barack Obama has granted the Castro Regime were done through executive order, which means the next President can reverse them - and that is what I will do, unless the Castro Regime meets our demands. Those demands will include religious and political freedom for the Cuban people.\n\nLet's also talk about Venezuela.\n\nVenezuela is a beautiful, vibrant, and resource-rich country, filled with amazing and hardworking people. But Venezuela has been run into the ground by socialists.\n\nThe next President of the United States must stand in solidarity with all people oppressed in our hemisphere, and I will stand with the oppressed people of Venezuela yearning to be free.\n\nHere, in America, I will push to expand freedom for all of our people.\n\nI am going to lower you taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations, on business and in your life; I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare; I'm going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution; I'm going to rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; I'm going to save your 2nd amendment; I'm going to stop illegal immigration and drugs coming into our country, and yes, we will build the wall and I'm going to renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, especially NAFTA - and we will make great trade deals that put the American worker first.\n\nWe will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.\n\nAmerican cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.\n\nAmerican steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.\n\nAmerican hands will rebuild this nation - and American energy, mined from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.\n\nWe will put new American steel into the spine of this country.\n\nI will fight for every neglected part of this nation - and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.\n\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\n\nIt is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.\n\nJobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores.\n\nOnce more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.\n\nWe Will Make America Prosperous Again.\n\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\n\nAnd Will Make America Great Again.\n\nThank you, and God Bless!\u0000","58":"Thank you. It's wonderful to be back in North Carolina.\nCome November 8, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House.\n\nWe are going to bring back your jobs.\n\nWe are going to cut your taxes.\n\nWe are going to renegotiate our disastrous trade deals.\n\nAnd we are going to protect our country from Radical Islamic Terrorism.\n\nOver the weekend, there were Islamic terrorist attacks in Minnesota and New York City, and in New Jersey. These attacks were made possible because of our extremely open immigration system, which fails to properly vet and screen the individuals or families coming into our country.\n\nAttack after attack - from 9\/11 to San Bernardino to Orlando - we have seen how failures to screen who is entering the United States puts all of our citizens in danger.\n\nSo let me state this very clearly: immigration security is national security.\n\nMy opponent has the most open borders policy of anyone ever to seek the presidency. As Secretary of State, she allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be released into our communities because their home countries wouldn't take them back.\n\nNow Obama wants to bring in an additional 110,000 refugees, and Hillary wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees. Altogether, Hillary Clinton's plan would bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term - with no effective way to screen or vet them. Her plan would cost $400 billion dollars in terms of lifetime welfare and entitlement costs.\n\nThis isn't just a matter of terrorism, but also quality of life. We want to make sure we are only admitting people into our country who love our country.\n\nMy highest duty as President is to protect our citizens and to uphold the Constitution of the United States. I will honor that duty to the fullest extent every single day - and I will never waver in that sacred obligation.\n\nIt's just a plain fact that our current immigration system makes no real attempt to determine the views of the people entering. Since 9\/11, hundreds of immigrants and their children have been implicated in terrorism and terrorist-related activity in the United States.\n\nNow we learn that another 858 immigrants from dangerous countries have slipped into our country and been granted citizenship despite pending deportation orders. This is unacceptable.\n\nAltogether, there are nearly 1 million individuals in the United States with deportation orders who have not yet been removed.\n\nIn the 20th Century, the United States defeated Fascism, Nazism, and Communism.\n\nNow we must defeat Radical Islamic Terrorism.\n\nYet, my opponent won't even say the words Radical Islamic Terrorism. In fact, Hillary Clinton talks tougher about my supporters than she does about Islamic terrorists. She calls the patriotic Americans who support our campaign - many of them cops and soldiers - deplorable and irredeemable. Has she ever talked that way about Radical Islam, or about those who oppress and murder women and gays overseas? Has Hillary Clinton ever called people who support these practices deplorable and irredeemable? In many countries overseas, non-believers face the death penalty - where is Hillary's condemnation here?\n\nLet's ask Hillary Clinton: how many people who subscribe to Radical Islamic views, and support the oppression of non-believers, would you call deplorable or irredeemable - or are those words reserved only for hardworking Americans that truly love their country and that support Donald Trump?\n\nAmerica can never elect a President, like Hillary Clinton, who apparently, with her choice of words, thinks decent American citizens are a bigger threat than Radical Islamic Terrorists.\n\nAnyone who cannot name our enemy, is not fit to lead this country. Anyone who cannot condemn the hatred, oppression and violence of Radical Islam lacks the moral clarity to serve as our President.\n\nThe commander-in-chief of this nation must speak with moral clarity and conviction. Our system of government is the best in the world and, as your President, I will defend our values - and speak out against all those who assault our values in any way.\n\nIt's also time to remember one very important word: accountability. All this disaster with ISIS happened on Hillary Clinton's watch.\n\nHer policies in Iraq, Libya and Syria are responsible for the rise of ISIS. Her attacks on me are all meant to deflect from her record of unleashing this monstrous evil upon us.\n\nHer timetable withdrawal from Iraq, her push for regime change in Libya and Syria, her open borders policies - these are the actions that unleashed the ISIS disaster.\n\nSo she will say and do anything to distract from that record of total failure.\n\nHer claim that my opposition to Radical Islamic Terrorism is a recruiting tool, demonstrates a level of ignorance about the terror threat that is disqualifying.\n\nWhen she says my opposition to radical Islamic Terror provides \"aid and comfort,\" to the enemy, we know that Hillary Clinton has once again demonstrated that she is dangerously unfit for office. Her comments are not only reckless, but beneath the dignity of the office she seeks.\n\nISIS is torturing, murdering, executing and exterminating people in a campaign of genocide. And what is Hillary Clinton's suggestion? That we should censor our vocabulary so as not to upset these butchers. I have news for Hillary Clinton: refusing to call out Radical Islam will not lessen the danger, it will only increase and embolden the danger - just like we have seen during her disastrous and failed tenure as Secretary of State.\n\nThe rise of ISIS is Hillary Clinton's foreign policy legacy.\n\nSecretary Clinton has helped to topple regimes, displace millions, and then opened the door to ISIS to enter our country. How is this a smart policy?\n\nHillary Clinton's decisions overseas have left us with the threat we face today - and her immigration policies will invite this threat onto our shores.\n\nWe must stop the massive inflow of refugees - which Hillary Clinton is trying to drastically increase. We should temporarily suspend immigration entirely from regions where safe and adequate screening cannot occur.\n\nPew polling shows that in many of the countries from which we draw large numbers of immigrants, extreme views about religion - such as the death penalty for those who leave the faith- are commonplace.\n\nIt is the job of a responsible government to admit only those who we expect to succeed and flourish here, and to become part of our incredible home. Hillary Clinton disagrees with this common sense rule, and it's one more reason why she can never be President.\n\nIt's time to break with the corruption, the bad judgement, and the failures of the past.\n\nIt is time to have a new American Future.\n\nWe are going to change our immigration system to reflect American values.\n\nWe are going to stop the policy of regime change overseas, and instead focus on working with our allies on a military campaign to utterly destroy ISIS and defeat Islamic terrorism. This will not only require military warfare, but also financial warfare, cyber warfare, and ideological warfare.\n\nBut to win this struggle, we need to be strong at home.\n\nWe are going to rebuild our country.\n\nAnd at the center of that effort will be the rebuilding of our inner cities.\n\nNearly 4 in 10 African-American children live in poverty, including 45% of African-American children under the age of six. 58% of African-American youth are not working.\n\nViolent crime rose in America's fifty largest cities last year. Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.\n\nMore than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since January of this year.\n\nThe schools are failing, the jobs are leaving, and millions are trapped in poverty.\n\nTo the African-American community, I say: vote for Donald J. Trump. I will fix it - I will bring back your jobs, I will fix your schools, and I will fight for you as no one ever has before.\n\nIt is time for a new civil rights agenda, one that promises safe communities, great education, and good-paying jobs.\n\nMy whole life has been about creating jobs. Hillary Clinton has spent her career destroying jobs - just look at upstate New York, and her terrible trade deals.\n\nHillary Clinton supported NAFTA, she supported China's entrance into the World Trade Organization, and she supported the job-killing deal with South Korea that she helped to push through.\n\nThe South Korean deal was supposed to create 70,000 jobs - instead, we lost 100,000 jobs and our trade deficit with South Korea has more than doubled.\n\nNext, Hillary Clinton wants the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n\nYour state has lost more than 4 in 10 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA. I am going to renegotiate this disastrous deal - and if we don't get the deal we want, I will walk away.\n\nOur trade deficit is now nearly $800 billion a year - this is the economic legacy of Hillary Clinton.\n\nBut we are going to turn it all around.\n\nMy economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words: Jobs, Jobs, Jobs.\n\nI am going to lower your taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations, on business and in your life; I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare; I'm going to create American energy independence; I'm going to make our government lean, responsible and efficient; I'm going to fix our terrible trade deals and defend American workers; I'm going to rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; and I'm going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution of the United States;\n\nWe will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.\n\nAmerican cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.\n\nAmerican steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.\n\nAmerican hands will rebuild this nation - and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.\n\nWe will put new American steel into the spine of this country.\n\nI will fight for every neglected part of this nation - and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.\n\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\n\nIt is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.\n\nJobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing onto our shores.\n\nOnce more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.\n\nWe Will Make America Wealthy Again.\n\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\n\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\n\nAnd We Will Make America Great Again.\n\nThank you, and God Bless!\u0000","59":"Thank you. It's great to be back in North Carolina.\nIn 62 days, we are going to win this state - and we are going to win the White House.\n\nThis is our chance to end years of injustice, corruption and betrayal.\n\nThis is our chance to solve all of the problems that have gone unsolved for so many years.\n\nFor how long have people been saying Washington is broken and controlled by special interests?\n\nThis is the year we can finally fix it.\n\nThat's because change has to come from outside of our broken and corrupt system.\n\nWe will never fix our rigged system by relying on the people who rigged it in the first place.\n\nWe will never solve our problems by relying on the politicians who created our problems.\n\nSo to every American who has been waiting for real change, your wait is over - your moment of liberation is at hand. A vote for Trump is a vote to restore Democracy, to heal our economy, and to bring millions of jobs back into every forgotten stretch of this country.\n\nThe change will begin my first day in office.\n\nFirst, we are going to eliminate every unconstitutional executive order and restore the rule of law to our land.\n\nThen, we are going to begin implementing plans for construction of a wall along our southern border. This will keep out the violent cartels and gangs, as well as their drugs that are poisoning our youth.\n\nBut that's just the beginning.\n\nI am going to ask Congress to send me a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare. Under Senate rules, that bill can be passed with 51 votes - meaning a Republican Congress and a Republican President can save Americans from this disaster in a single afternoon.\n\nIt's going to be a very busy first day.\n\nI am going to instruct the Department of State to immediately suspend the Syrian refugee resettlement program and develop plans for the construction of a safe zone in the region. My opponent wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees. She is running to be America's Angela Merkel.\n\nI am also going to notify all countries that refuse to take back dangerous illegal immigrants who have committed crimes in this country that they will lose access to our visa programs if they continue to do so. This is the measure that is called for under current law, and I will enforce it.\n\nThe Secretary of State is required to take this action, but Hillary Clinton refused to do so - resulting in thousands of criminal aliens being released into U.S. communities.\n\nFurthermore, I will direct every agency in government to begin identifying all wasteful job-killing regulations and they are going to be removed - this will include lifting the restrictions on American energy.\n\nI will also notify our NAFTA partners of my intention to renegotiate the deal, and will withdraw from the TPP before it can be ratified. We are going to bring these jobs back to North Carolina.\n\nHillary Clinton supported NAFTA, she supported China's entry into the World Trade Organization, and she supported the TPP. She just does whatever her donors tell her to do.\n\nIn a Trump Administration, we will negotiate trade deals on behalf of American workers - not on behalf of global corporations.\n\nWe will work to ensure farmers in North Carolina have the tools they need to thrive at home and compete on a level playing field in foreign markets - and that means negotiating fair trade deals that put America First.\n\nCrucially, I am also going to convene my top generals and give them a simple instruction: they will have 30 days to submit to the Oval Office a plan for defeating ISIS. Any nation who shares in this goal will be our friend in this mission.\n\nFor years, we have been caught up in endless wars and conflicts under the leadership of failed politicians and a failed foreign policy establishment in Washington D.C. The same people who made every wrong decision in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, Egypt, China and Russia are the same people who are advising Hillary Clinton.\n\nI am proud instead to have the support of our warfighting generals, active duty military officers, and top military experts who know how to win - and know how to keep us out of endless war.\n\nToday, 88 retired U.S. generals and admirals signed a letter of endorsement.\n\nThat's one of the biggest differences between me and Hillary Clinton. She favors what has been called military adventurism - rushing to invade countries, displacing millions of families, then inviting the refugees into our country - creating power vacuums filled by terrorist groups like ISIS.\n\nI believe in a foreign policy based on our national interests that focuses on American security and regional stability - instead of using our military to create Democracies in countries with no Democratic history.\n\nWe will work to form partnerships overseas based on a long-term strategy of defeating Radical Islamic Terrorism.\n\nWe will first have to reverse the damage inflicted by Hillary Clinton - her legacy of failure in the Middle East, Russia and Asia has made Americans less safe than ever before.\n\nAs part of our plan to avoid and prevent foreign conflicts, we are going to rebuild our depleted military. This is the ultimate deterrent.\n\nWe will be guided by those three famous words: Peace Through Strength.\n\nI will ask Congress to eliminate the sequester and immediately re-invest in our military. Right now, we have the smallest air force since 1947, the smallest army since 1939, and one of the smallest Navy's since 1917.\n\nLike the Cold War, we also need to fight this battle by collecting intelligence and then protecting our classified secrets. Hillary Clinton has taught us all how much of a problem we have with cyber-security.\n\nWe can't have someone in the Oval Office who doesn't understand the meaning of the word confidential.\n\nThe new revelations about Hillary Clinton from the just-released FBI documents make more clear than ever that she fails to meet the minimum standard for running for public office. If she applied for a low-level job at the State Department today she couldn't even get a security clearance.\n\nHer conduct is disqualifying.\n\nLet's run through what we discovered in those FBI documents. It's important, and we're hoping Matt Lauer will ask about it on Wednesday night at the Townhall.\n\nIt's clear from the FBI report that Hillary Clinton lied about her handling of confidential information. She repeatedly told the country that she understood the classified system, then she told the FBI she didn't understand that the letter \"C\" meant confidential in the documents she emailed.\n\nOn 39 separate occasions she said she couldn't recall details about her mishandling of classified information, and she couldn't even name one step she took to make sure foreign hackers couldn't get into her server. Keep in mind, that her insecure emails included emails about the drone program.\n\nIt's also clear from the FBI report that Hillary Clinton and her top aides knowingly destroyed evidence and covered-up their actions. After her private server was revealed last March, her staff deleted all the emails and wiped it clean using a software designed to prevent any recovery, called BleachBit.\n\nThey used hammers to destroy phones so they couldn't be turned over later - and by the way, who uses 12 different phones in 4 years? The only people who use that many phones are usually involved in very, very shady activity.\n\nPeople who have nothing to hide don't smash phones with hammers. People who have nothing to hide don't bleach their emails, or destroy evidence to keep it from being publicly archived as required under federal law.\n\nHillary Clinton failed to turn over thousands of documents, then tried to shield her criminal conduct by having her chief-of-staff declare herself to be Hillary Clinton's private attorney.\n\nHillary and her top aides told the FBI and others in related lawsuits that they couldn't recall or remember key facts hundreds of different times - and that's in addition to the guy who set up the server pleading the 5th.\n\nNo one takes all the risks Hillary Clinton took unless they are trying to cover up massive crimes.\n\nHillary Clinton was using the State Department to dole out special favors and access to her friends and donors.\n\nIt's called pay-for-play.\n\nOne example of pay-for-play is what the Clinton's did in Haiti. Let me stop here for a second and say how much we love and appreciate the Haitian-American community in Florida and across our country. We send our prayers to the many still suffering in Haiti from the earthquake.\n\nBut while Haiti has suffered, the Clintons and their pals have cashed in.\n\nBill and Hillary's brothers have signed housing deals in Haiti, and one wound up on the board of a gold mining company.\n\nClinton Foundation donors have seen the Clintons pave the way for their investments.\n\nIn one deal, Hillary Clinton set aside environmental and labor rules to help a South Korean company with a record of violating workers' rights set up what amounts to a sweat shop in Haiti.\n\nThe facility has produced only a fraction of the jobs it promised and faces reports of wage theft.\n\nPeople are asking: where did all the money go?\n\nThis November, it is up to the American people to stop the Clintons from raiding America the way they have raided so many other people and places.\n\nOne of the groups in America that have been harmed the most by Hillary Clinton's policies are African-Americans. She sees them only as votes, not as people worthy of a better future.\n\nMany African-Americans have succeeded so greatly in this country, we will honor and protect their achievements. That includes lowering taxes for our small business owners to fifteen percent.\n\nBut millions of African-Americans in our inner cities remain trapped in poverty, joblessness and failing schools.\n\nThe Democratic Party has run the inner cities for fifty, sixty, seventy years and more.\n\n4 in 10 African-American children in poverty, including 45% of those under the age of six.\n\n58% of African-American youth are not working.\n\n2,900 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.\n\nNationwide, African-Americans are nearly 60% of the murder victims under the age of 22.\n\nThis is a national crisis - and anybody who fails to understand that is not fit to seek the Presidency of the United States.\n\nTo those suffering in crime and poverty, I say: give Donald J. Trump a chance. What do you have to lose by embracing our platform of change? We are going to bring back your jobs, rebuild your cities, and give parents and students school choice. I will never, ever, ever take you for granted.\n\nWe are going to push a new Civil Rights agenda. We believe every American has the right to a safe community, a great education and government that protects their jobs.\n\nThis weekend, I had the honor to join a church service in Detroit at the Great Faith Ministries International with the amazing Bishop Wayne Jackson. It was an incredible and deeply moving experience.\n\nI will fight for Detroit, for Chicago, for Baltimore, and for every neglected part of this nation - and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.\n\nLet me quote the same passage from the Bible I read on Saturday, from 1 John 4: \"No one has ever seen God; but, if we love one another, God lives in us and his love is made complete in us.\"\n\nImagine what we our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One Flag.\n\nIt is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a New American Future.\n\nIn this future, we will respect the dignity of all Americans - and that means great jobs, great schools, and great neighborhoods.\n\nWe will keep our children safe - which requires secure borders, a strong military, and supporting law enforcement.\n\nJobs will return, prosperity will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores.\n\nGovernment corruption will end - and the State Department will answer to the voters, not Hillary Clinton's donors.\n\nRepublicans are the Party of Abraham Lincoln and, come November 8th, we will once again have a government of, by and for the people.\n\nWe Will Make America Proud Again.\n\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\n\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\n\nAnd Will Make America Great Again.\n\nThank you, and God Bless!\u0000","60":"Hello, Dade City!\nI am so excited about being here. Thank you, all for this really warm, wonderful welcome. And I thank, on behalf of all of us I want to thank Alicia Machado for that introduction and for sharing her story with us. Alicia will be voting for the very first time in this election, and I am very grateful for her support. I'm also delighted that we're joined today by your great senator Bill Nelson and his wife Grace.\n\nI also want to thank Representative Amanda Hickman from the Florida State House, Michael Cox, chairman of the Greater Pasco Chamber of Commerce, Michael Ledbetter, who is the Pasco County Democratic executive committee chair and his wife Beverly. And thanks to retired Colonel Wilson Elton  for his pledge of allegiance. And thanks to all the elected officials here. And I especially want to thank all of you for not just joining us but helping us to get out the vote in this last week!\n\nIt's almost hard to believe, isn't it? There are only seven days left in this election.\n\nSo are you ready to vote?\n\nAre you ready to volunteer these last seven days?\n\nI hope too that you ready to elect Patrick Murphy to the United States Senate! Patrick, who's been in Congress, will be an independent voice for Florida families. And I am so excited to think about what he could do, because unlike his opponent, he's never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump.\n\nNow somebody asked me the other day, 'Why do you keep coming back to Florida?' Just look around folks. I mean it is a beautiful, and I have lots of friends, but it's also really important in this election. Florida can decide who our next president is, which will affect the nation and the world. And I want to make sure that every voter in Florida spends these next seven days thinking about what's at stake in this election. Because honestly I believe this may be the most important election of our lifetimes.\n\nOne week from today, we will be choosing our next president and commander-in-chief of the United States. I don't think the choice could be any clearer. I have spent my career fighting for children and families. I have served in the United States Senate, served on the Senate Armed Services Committee. I was in the Situation Room when we brought Osama Bin Laden to justice. I represented you as your secretary of state, going to 112 countries, negotiating with friend and foe alike. I am ready to serve if you give me the great honor of being your president.\n\nNow, I do have to say that I think that stands in contrast to my opponent. And maybe for you if you think about all of the issues that separate Donald Trump from me, it could be his dangerous statements about nuclear weapons.\n\nWhen a journalist told Donald Trump that people were worried about how casually he talks about using nuclear weapons, he said, 'Well then why are we making them?'\n\nAnd I have to tell you yesterday I was in Ohio, and I was introduced by a gentleman who was one of our officers in charge of launching nuclear weapons if the order ever came from our president. And what he told the crowd \u00c3\u0091 it was a big crowd at Kent State University \u00c3\u0091 I think every voter should hear. Basically \u00c3\u0091 his name was Bruce Blair \u00c3\u0091 he said that, having had the responsibility of sitting in a bunker, being responsible for the codes and the keys to our nuclear weapons, he knows that when a president makes the order to launch a nuclear attack, there is no appeal. There is no veto. And that is why he has joined with dozens of former Air Force officers to send a letter to say, 'We need a president with the temperament, the steadiness, the calmness to be in charge of nuclear weapons.' And therefore they cannot support Donald Trump, because he does not have the temperament to be our commander-in-chief and handle those responsibilities.\n\nSo when you think about voting, early this week, voting next Tuesday, responsibility for our nuclear weapons is on the ballot.\n\nSo is immigration. Do we want to round up millions of people who are here working, raising their families, as he has suggested he will do? I don't think so. I think what we want is to bring them out of the shadows so that they can't be exploited by employers like Donald Trump, who refused to hire Americans and hired undocumented workers so he could pay them less. I don't think that's right.\n\nNow maybe for some of you, what Donald Trump said about prisoners of war will be enough reason to vote against him, somebody who questioned the patriotism and the service of John McCain because he was a prison of war. We need a Commander in Chief who respects the service and sacrifice of the men and women who wear our uniform.\n\nOr maybe for some of you, it's what he said about a judge born in Indiana, who just happened to be assigned the case brought by people who were defrauded by the phony Trump University. And so Trump said, 'Well, we can't trust him because his parents were born in Mexico.' Now Paul Ryan, the Republican Speaker of the House, called \u00c3\u0091 well, but wait a minute, \u00c3\u0091 he called what Trump said about that distinguished federal judge, 'The definition of a racist comment.'\n\nAnd then Trump went on to attack a Gold Star family whose son, Captain Khan, died defending our country, simply because that family was Muslim.\n\nAnd then let's not forget, Trump spent years, years insisting that President Obama was not born in the United States, even after the birth certificate was produced. Honestly if this were something new, I think we'd all be asking ourselves, 'Well, what does he have against President Obama?' Or what does he have against me? But this is not new. I know I'm reaching out to Republicans and Independents as well as Democrats because I want to be the president for all Americans.\n\nAnd here's what I want you to tell. I want you to tell your Republican friends, in 1987 Donald Trump took out a Donald Trump took out a $100,000 ad in the New York Times to criticize President Reagan. He said, 'Our leaders are the laughing stock of the world.' So this is a man who thinks that he is better than President Reagan, better than President Obama - literally better than anybody, I guess. And, when you think about it, what he said at the convention, 'I alone can fix it,' runs counter to who we are as Americans. We work together.\n\nSo there are many reasons why I think it is fair to conclude that Donald Trump is unqualified and unfit to be president. But today, I want to just spend a few minutes focusing in particular about what he has said and what he has done to woman and girls because - Any of you see the debates? I stood next to Donald for four and a half hours during those three debates, proving conclusively I have the stamina to be President of the United States. And during those debates, Donald always used to say, 'What have you been doing for 30 years?' And I always found that kind of odd, because he could Google it and find out. And so I've been a lawyer, and I've been a first lady, and I've been a senator, and I've been Secretary of State, and I've been a wife and a mother and a grandmother and a friend and a churchgoer, and for my entire life I've been a woman.\n\nAnd when I think about what we now know about Donald Trump and what he's been doing for 30 years, he sure has spent a lot of time demeaning, degrading, insulting, and assaulting women. And, I've got to tell you, some of what we've learned - some of this stuff is very upsetting. I would, frankly, rather be here talking about nearly anything else, like how we're going to create good jobs and get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top. How we're going to make college affordable for every single family, because I have a plan that if your family makes less than $125,000, you will not pay tuition to go to a state college or university. And if you're above that, it will be debt free, and we will help you pay back the debt you already have so you can get out from under it.\n\nBut I can't just talk about all of the good things we want to do, because people are making up their minds. This is a consequential choice, so we've got to talk about something that, frankly, is painful, because it matters. We can't just wish it away. And a lot of his supporters don't like to hear this. I don't blame them. If I were supporting him, I wouldn't want to hear it either, to be honest. But I've got to tell you, I learned way back in elementary school and I learned it in Sunday school: it's not okay to insult people. It's not okay.\n\nAnd look at what he does. He calls women 'ugly,' 'disgusting,' 'nasty' all the time. He calls women 'pigs,' rates bodies on a scale from 1 to 10. We just heard from Alicia. She was Miss Universe when Donald Trump owned the pageant. Well, he said she put on some weight and it made him angry, so he called her 'Miss Piggy.' He called her 'Miss Housekeeping' because she's a beautiful Latina. He brought a bunch of reporters to a gym to watch him order her around to exercise. Now, he also said, 'This is somebody who likes to eat.' Well, I have to say: who doesn't like to eat? I mean, really, can we just stop for a minute and reflect on the absurdity of Donald Trump finding fault with Miss Universe?\n\nBut you've got to ask: why does he do these things? Who acts like this? And, I'll tell you who: a bully, that's who. And thankfully, Alicia refuses to let such a small person get her down. She knows that Donald Trump doesn't get to decide her value in her eyes and in the eyes of her family and her friends.\n\nBut what about our girls? What about girls watching all this? What happens to their confidence, their sense of self-worth? If you've got a daughter, a granddaughter, a sister, a mother, a wife, a good friend, someone like this becoming president who insults more than half the population of the United States of America? And what about our boys? This is not someone we want them looking up to.\n\nNot so long ago, I was the mother of a teenage girl. And every day I tried to make sure that she knew she was smart and she was capable, and I'm doing the same thing with my granddaughter and my grandson. Because, let's be honest here, the world has a way of telling our girls exactly the opposite - they don't look right, they're not thin enough, they don't act right, no one will like them unless they change their clothes or straighten their hair or stop being bossy, or whatever the criticism might be. Right?\n\nAnd I remember, when Chelsea was a teenager, I would wait on the second floor of the White House in the long hall that's there for her to come home from school. And sometimes, we only had a few minutes together. But before she'd run off to talk to her friends or do whatever she was planning to, I would figure out how was the day. We'd talk about what was on her mind. And that time together was really valuable to me as a parent, because we parents, and I know there are a lot of parents here today, we work hard to give our kids a sense of confidence to send them out into the world believing in their own value, and it really is important that we don't let anybody take that away from them. And we want them to be strong, and we don't want them to feel bad about themselves. And we've got to work hard to make sure our boys, just like our girls, have that same sense of positive energy: not negative, not tearing people down - lifting people up and respecting women.\n\nIn fact, all of us should respect each other in our country. So, when I look at my granddaughter and my grandson, I am on the same mission. I want them to know they're love, they're cared for, they're respected. I want them to develop a good work ethic. I believe in hard work, and I want them to go out and prove themselves in the world. But that's what I want for every child. I have spent my life doing everything I could to help kids and families. It will be the mission of my presidency. I will get up every day in the White House trying to figure out: how can we knock down the barriers, overcome the challenges so that people living here in Pasco County can get ahead and stay ahead?\n\nSo I know there's work to be done. We can't do it with just words alone. We've got to do more to stop treatment about women being somehow objectified. And, oh my gosh, when we heard that tape and we heard what he does to women. I'm not going to repeat it. But you know what Donald Trump was bragging about: grabbing women, mistreating women. And I have to tell you, since that tape came out, twelve women have come to say that, 'What he said on that tape is what he did to me.'\n\nAnd then we heard his response. What he does at his rallies is to go after those women all over again, insulting them. He said he couldn't possibly have said those things because the women weren't attractive enough to assault. 'Look at her,' he said about one woman. 'I don't think so.' About another, he said, 'She wouldn't be my first choice.'\n\nHe's also on tape bragging with the radio personality Howard Stern about how he used to go backstage at beauty pageants to barge in on the women while they were getting dressed. He said he did that \u00c3\u0091 he said he did that to 'inspect' them. That was his word - and he said, 'I sort of get away with things like that.' And sure enough, contestants have come forward to say, 'Yes, that's exactly what he did to us.' Now, as bad as that is, he didn't just do it at the Miss USA pageant or the Miss Universe pageant. He's also been accused of doing it at the Miss Teen USA pageant. Contestants say that Donald Trump came in to look at them when they were changing. Some of them were just 15 years old.\n\nWe cannot hide from this. We've got to be willing to face it. This man wants to be president of the United States of America and our First Lady, Michelle Obama, spoke for many of us when she said Donald Trump's words have shaken her to her core.\n\nFor a lot of women who have gone through something like this in your lives, that's brought back painful memories. And for men who would never, ever talk or act like Donald, it's been shocking to see this. He tried to explain it away as 'locker room talk,' well, I'll tell you what, a lot of professional athletes stood up and said, 'Not in our locker rooms. That does not happen.'\n\nWell, I guess the bottom line is he thinks belittling women makes him a bigger man.\n\nAnd I don't think there's a woman anywhere who doesn't know what that feels like.\n\nHe doesn't look at us and see full human beings, with our dreams and purposes, our own capabilities. And he has shown us that clearly throughout this campaign.\n\nWell, he's very wrong. He is wrong about both the women and the men of this country. He has shown us who he is. Let us on Tuesday show him who we are. We can stand up for what we believe, what we want for our children and grandchildren, what we know is right. And you can go down the list of everything he has said. He doesn't believe in equal pay, he thinks pregnancy is an inconvenience, he won't raise the minimum wage, and he said if he comes home and dinner is not on the table, he gets angry. Instead of supporting women who are out there supporting their families, he wants to make it even harder.\n\nWell, I have a message for him. We're going to fight for affordable childcare. We're going to fight for equal pay for all people. We're going to fight for paid family leave, we're going to fight to make sure everybody gets raising wages in America and that's important because so many people still struggling, still working hard, raising a family, having a hard time getting all of their bills paid. And that's especially true for minimum wage workers \u00c3\u0091 who \u00c3\u0091 two-thirds of whom are women, so we've got work to do my friends. I'm excited because I know we can do this and I will stand up and I will fight for you, I will work for you, I will give my heart to this mission of making our country all it should be. Because instead of Donald Trump's dangerous and divisive vision, mine is positive, optimistic, hopeful and unifying.\n\nBut I can't do any of this without your help. Early voting has already begun. Almost 26 millions Americans have already voted and that includes four million right here in Florida. Americans are voting for the kind of better future we can make together. And voting on all the issues that they care about. It may be my name and Donald's name on the ballot but everything you care about, our security, our economy, bringing our country together, the environment, clean water and clean air!\n\nHere in Dade City, you can vote every day from now until November 5th, from 7am to 7pm.\n\nIn fact, right now, the East Pasco Government Center is just a few minutes' drive away. You can go there right after this rally and vote. Because, we need everybody to stand up in this election.\n\nAnd if you have a mail-in ballot at home, send it in when you get home today.\n\nDon't wait to send it back! Talk friends and family and neighbors and co-workers.\n\nDonald Trump's strategy is pretty simple- he said he wants to suppress young people from voting women from voting, people of color from voting, that is a lot of people. By showing up with the biggest turnout ever we will show him and everybody a message that that is not who we are.\n\nNow I know here in this county and this larger region, you probably know some people who are going to vote for Trump. And here is what I want to ask you, I want you to talk with them. Ask them what they care about. Ask them what kind of future they want for their economy. Because Donald Trump's economic plan is slashing taxes on the wealthy and big corporations. I have said that I want the wealthy to pay their fair share and I will not raise taxes on anybody making less than $250,000 a year.\n\nSo there could not be, no matter what you care about, a bigger difference between me and Donald Trump, and I hope that you will come out and volunteer for these last seven days.\n\nWe are signing up for volunteer shifts making calls, knocking on doors, it really matters, turn out matters.\n\nPlease go to hillaryclinton.com to see how you can get involved. Here is what I want to leave you with. You know, I feel like so many of you, our country is already great but we can make is greater. The main reason America is great is because America is good. We are a big hearted, generous people. Not a small minded people. We know that if everybody works together we will get farther together than if we separate people, we push them down, we engage in all the negativity that we have heard too much in this campaign. But sometimes, the fate of even the greatest nations lie in the balance. For America, this is one of those make or break elections. It really is in your hands.\n\nI hope you will think about how you will feel the day after the election on November 9th. are we going to more forward together or are we going to move backwards by someone who wants to bully us? And I hope, I hope you will think about how together we can make a difference, I want to be your partner as well as your president, I want us to create the best possible future for our children and our grandchildren. That is what I will work my heart out to do and I hope you will help me to make a better, fairer, stronger America. Where we prove once and for all that love trumps hate!\n\nThank you all.\u0000","61":"Hello, Broward County!Whoa. It is so great to be back in Florida. There are just 14 days, two weeks from today.\nThe most important election in our lifetimes. I'm so grateful to see all of you and I want to thank the elected officials who are here, Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman-Schult,\n\nCongressman Alcee Hastings, Congressman Ted Deutch, Commissioner Mark Bogen and others who are here, along with Senator Bill Nelson's wonderful wife, Grace Nelson. So we are glad you are all here with me.\n\nAnd I got to tell you, I was thrilled to be introduced by the person I hope will be the next senator from the great state of Florida, Congressman Patrick Murphy.You know, I think Patrick is exactly the kind of senator that Florida needs and deserves because he will help us break through gridlock and create more good jobs with rising incomes. And Patrick knows we have to build an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not from the top down.\n\nI also appreciate the fact that we now are seeing an emerging bipartisan consensus that we need to fix our broken criminal justice system, do you agree? But it's going to take strong and committed leaders, like Patrick Murphy, who are ready to show up and fight hard and work to get this done. And -- and this is important, my friends, unlike his opponent, Patrick Murphy has never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump.\n\nI think Florida deserves a senator who's going to fight for comprehensive immigration reform that will keep families together against a deportation force.\n\nThis is what is so unimaginable, of law enforcement officials to go door to door, house to house, business to business, school to school, rounding up 11 million people. I think that is so wrong, and it is not going to happen in America. So you deserve also a senator who actually believes climate change is real, as opposed to someone who every time he's asked says, well I'm not a scientist. And I always wonder, why don't you talk to a scientist? Like start here at Broward College, you could talk to scientists.\n\nAnd you deserve a senator who would never say that Social Security and Medicare have, and this is a quote, \"weakened us as a people.\"\n\nHis solution, Patrick's opponent's solution, is to privatize Medicare.\n\n Boo!\n\n That is exactly the right response, but don't boo, vote, right?\n\nAnd you deserve a senator who would never support cutting $360 million from Florida's schools, because Patrick knows every child in Florida deserves a world-class education. So my friends, Patrick Murphy is a smart, tough-minded legislator and an independent voice.\n\nThat's what we need more of in Washington, people like Patrick who are going to get up every day and go to work for you, a better life for you and your families, instead of blocking progress at every turn, listening to the special interests and powerful forces that really are not interested in what it's going to take for every one of you to get ahead and stay ahead.\n\nSo please, when you get out and vote, please remember you can send Patrick Murphy to the United States Senate, and you will be glad you did.\n\nNow, I know there's an overflow crowd outside and I'm so sorry they can't be in, but I'm told that they can hear us and maybe even see us, and I want to thank them for coming as well.\n\nI got to ask you, did anybody see the last debate?\n\nWell, the good news -- the good news was, it was the last debate.\n\n Happy birthday to you!\n\n Well, thank you!\n\nThank you. Yeah, you know, you're right. That last debate was like an early birthday present, right? But here's what I wanted you to remember. I stood next to Donald Trump for four and a half hours, proving once again I have the stamina to be president and commander- in-chief.\n\nYou know, I tried as much as I could to talk about all issues that are on your minds that I believe we can work together to improve. And in fact, my wonderful running mate I, Senator Tim Kaine, wrote a book, called \"Stronger Together,\" and we put all of our policies in it because I want you to know what we're going to try to do if we're so fortunate enough to be the next president and vice president.\n\nAnd I think it's important, because I want you to have confidence that we're going to work every day to implement the plans that we have put forth. And I tried in the debate to draw the contrasts with Donald Trump, who doesn't really have very many plans. You know, I've tried to run a campaign based on issues, he's run a campaign based on insults. And so in the debate, we didn't have a lot to talk about, other than he continued true to form to throw out his insults.\n\nBut in that last debate, he said something that I found horrifying. Well, he said a lot of things, cut there's one thing in particular that I wanted to point out because no presidential candidate, Republican or Democrat, has ever said this. He refused to say that he would respect the outcome the election.\n\nI guess we shouldn't be too surprised, this is the same guy who said he thought the Emmys were rigged against him. But this is serious. You know, on January 20th, the first thing a president does is to take an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution, and I have serious doubts about whether Donald Trump even understands what that means.\n\nIn America, we don't say we're going to keep you in suspense about whether we will respect the outcome of an election. We have free and fair elections and the peaceful transfer of power. That is one thing that makes American great, it makes America who we are.\n\nAnd we don't impose religious tests at our borders because we are a country that was founded on religious liberty. And we don't punish newspapers or journalists that try to cover the news or are critical of politicians, or threaten to restrict the First Amendment, because our democracy depends on a free press. And we don't incite violence and turn people against each other. We respect the open exchange of ideas that a democracy depends on.\n\nYou know, I've got to say, I bet some of you or maybe your parents, or your grandpar-ents, came from places where none of that was true, right? There is a reason why America is the greatest and longest lasting democracy the world has ever known, because we believe that no matter what you look like or where your parents were born or who you love, you have the right to be treated equally and fairly in the United States.\n\nAnd Donald Trump is attacking everything that has set our country apart for 240 years. Now, after spending his entire campaign attacking one group of Americans after another -- immigrants, African Americans, Latinos, women, POWs, Muslims, people with disabilities -- now his final target is democracy itself. So here's what I want you to know, in the four years, we are going to change some things in America, right?\n\nI do want to get the economy working for everyone, not just those at the top. And we're going to do that, along with other positive changes, but we are not going to change the fundamental values that made America the greatest nation in the history of the world.\n\nYou know, I think it all started -- I think this all started when George Washington re-fused to become a king. Right? Now, Donald Trump probably would have called him a loser.\n\nInstead, that was one of the most important decisions any president has ever made. Eight years, it's time to move on. We fought a revolution so that we would not have a king. We would not be subjects, we would be independent citizens. I cherish that idea.\n\nSo here's the good news. Americans are coming together. At the very moment when Donald Trump is making an unprecedented attack on our democracy, millions of people are registering, voting early and volunteering in this campaign.\n\nAnd here's something very exciting. We have reached a milestone. More than 200 million Americans are now registered, and that includes 15 million young people, the most ever in history.\n\nAnd you know what? More than six million people have already voted and more than one million of them are right here in Florida.\n\nSo I think you only see numbers like this when people are standing up for what they really believe in, and that includes not just Democrats but Republicans and Independents coming together to reject hate and division, and I am so excited about what that means.\n\nBut the energy we are seeing across Florida and America is not just because of what we are against, it's about what we're for. It really is. It's about fighting for that future where everyone counts, everyone has a place and no one is left out or behind. But I want you to know we still have a lot of work to do. I feel good, but boy, I am not taking anything for granted. I'm going to work as hard as I can between now and the close of the election that's two weeks from today.\n\nAnd you know, it's so important for Florida. There are so many issues that we need to remind people about. Last time I was here, I campaigned with Al Gore and he said a lot about the climate crisis. And you know why? Because we're seeing the reality of climate change every day in Florida. We are seeing areas in Miami even on sunny days without a drop of rain where the streets are flooding. And the ocean is rising.\n\nAnd what we've got to do is make sure that this issue -- fighting climate change, creating clean renewable energy jobs -- stays at the top of the priorities, and that's why you need a new senator like Patrick Murphy.\n\nI have to say, nobody should want to wake up on November 9th and wonder whether there was more you could have done. I hope you will wake up on November 9th proud that you took a stand and voted for an America that belongs to all of us, where we set big goals and we work together to achieve them.\n\nI got to tell you, I believe America is great because America is good.\n\nAnd I want to tell you one other thing. I want to say one other thing that's really very important to me. We should honor the men and women in uniform who fight for our country.\n\nThat's why I was so appalled when Donald Trump tweeted that the new effort underway to push the terrorists out of the key city of Mosul is already, and I quote him, \"a total disaster\" and that our country is, again a quote, \"looking dumb.\" Really? He's declaring defeat before the battle has even started. He's proving once again he is unqualified to be commander in chief of our military.\n\nHere's another example. He was asked if he would defend our allies. He said well, first he'd want to know if they made any payments to us to defend them. And when asked specifically about Israel, he said, and I quote again, he would \"love to be neutral.\"\n\nNow, we can't have a president who says he's neutral on Monday, pro-Israel on Tuesday, and who knows what on Wednesday, because in his mind, everything is negotiable.\n\nI have a different view. We stand with our allies. We stand with those who will help us defeat terrorism.\n\nSo I -- I get pretty excited about what we could to together. And with your help, we're going to make the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II -- jobs in infra-structure and advanced manufacturing, and clean renewable energy, and small busi-nesses. I want us to make America the clean energy super power of the 21st century.\n\nWe can create millions of jobs and protect our planet at the same time. And I've got to say no state, no state should care more about this issue than Florida. Right? And you know, I'll tell you something that it's kind of sad, to be honest with you. I've traveled all over the country. And in New Jersey and Massachusetts, they have more solar power than the Sunshine State.\n\nWhy? Well, because you have a governor and a legislature who, like your current senator, doesn't want to believe the science of climate change; doesn't see the opportunity that Florida has to be literally the global leader in clean energy.\n\nAnd so I want to deploy a half-billion more solar panels by the end of my first term, and enough clean energy to power every home in America within 10 years.\n\nAnd we're also going to strengthen education at every level, starting with universal pre-K, and working -- working with our teachers to make sure every child has a good school with good teachers in every zip code. And here's what I want all the students to hear, we're going to make college more affordable for everyone.\n\nYou know, after our primary, which was hard-fought, and I was proud of the primary we ran because it was about issues. Senator Sanders and I got together, came up with a plan to make public colleges and universities tuition-free for any families making less than $125,000 a year.\n\nThat's the vast majority of families. And if you're over that, we're going to make it debt-free. So pay what you can afford. But I don't want to see young people and their families going into debt. I view this as an investment. And that's why we're going to make it easier for you to afford to pay back your college debt -- pay it down and pay it off.\n\nAnd I also want more pathways to good jobs that don't require a four-year college de-gree. Let's return technical education to high schools. Let's do more with our community colleges. Let's have more apprenticeship programs so that everybody has a chance at a good job.\n\nAnd you know, in addition -- in addition to making the economy grow and making sure people are ready with the skills to do these jobs, I want to make it fairer. That's why I want to raise the national minimum wage. If you work full-time, you shouldn't still be in poverty. And don't you think it is finally maybe past time to guarantee equal pay for women's work?\n\nAnd, you know, I always tell crowds, this is not a women's issue. It's a family issue. If you have a wife, a mother, a sister or a daughter working, it's your issue. And that's why we have got to get this fixed once and for all.\n\nAnd let's make childcare affordable. And let's have more profit sharing. And let's do the kinds of things that will lift everybody up. Now, you know, when I talk about raising equal pay for women as one of my primary issues, you know, Donald Trump or somebody always says, well, there she goes playing the woman card. And I've got to tell you, I don't believe that's what it is. I think we're paying -- playing the smart card.\n\nBecause we want everybody's incomes to go up. That's how we're going to get this economy really moving forward, creating new jobs. And so if that's playing the woman card, you know what we say, deal me in.\n\nI've also said I will pledge not to do anything that would raise taxes on people making less than $250,000 a year, because we don't need to do that. We can go where the money is, the millionaires and the billionaires, the corporations, to make them pay their fair share to support the kind of growth that we need in our economy.\n\nWe're going to close the loopholes and make sure no multi- millionaire can get away with paying a lower rate than a nurse or a police officer or a teacher.\n\nNow remember when we learned in one of the debates that Donald Trump hadn't paid any federal taxes?\n\nFor about 20 years is the best guess we've got, and his excuse, I love his excuse, his excuse was well, he lost $1 billion in a year.\n\nI've been really pondering this. How does anybody lose $1 billion in a year, especially when you're running casinos? Think about it. Has anybody here ever been to a casino?\n\n Yes!\n\n Well, you know, usually they say the house wins, so Donald Trump said it was smart for him to avoid paying taxes. Well, if losing $1 billion is smart, I think that's kind of upside down and backwards. I think people should be working hard to make their incomes, to support their families, and that's what we're going to do because we don't want the kind of values that Donald Trump used in running his business to be in our government.\n\nHe stiffs -- he stiffs small businesses. My dad was a small business owner. Donald Trump has refused to pay all kinds of folks, workers, small businesses installing drapes or marble or glass, or where he bought pianos, he didn't pay them. He just doesn't pay them and he gets away with it because he turns and he says to these small businesses well, go ahead and sue me.\n\nWell, my dad, because he was a small business man, I know he could never have afforded that, so I'm just glad he never got a contract from Donald Trump, because our family would have been hurt by that.\n\nSo here's the bottom line and here's what I need you to do. We have got to get everybody you know to turn out and vote, and you have early voting now and it's going to be much easier for some of you to vote early. And if you believe in any of the issues that we have talked about in this campaign, if you believe that women and girls should be treated with respect, if you believe that marriage equality should be protected.\n\nIf you believe -- if believe in science and believe we should take action, if you believe America belongs to everybody willing to work for it and we should stand up against any kind of negative tax, then I hope you will come out and vote because it's going to be a close election. Pay no attention to the polls. Don't get -- don't get complacent, because we've got to turn people out.\n\nSo I'm asking you to vote for me, I'm asking you to send Patrick Murphy to the Senate, I'm asking you most importantly to vote for yourselves, because really, that's what is at stake. So early voting began here in south Florida yesterday. It goes through Sunday, November 6th. You can go to your early voting site in your county between 7 AM and 7 PM. In fact, you can go across the street right now to the North Regional Library and cast your ballot today.\n\nAnd we have volunteers and staff ready to escort you, so hey, go ahead and vote now. And you can go to iwillvote.com to confirm your polling place and make sure you have a plan to vote. But don't stop there. If you will join us in these next two weeks, every phone call you make, every door you knock on will make a difference. So please, go to HillaryClinton.com, sign up to volunteer, take out your phone, text JOIN to 47246, and get involved, because the bigger the turnout, the bigger statement we will make about the kind of country we are and the future we want to build together.\n\nNow, let me just end by saying that people ask me all the time, you know, what moti-vates you, how do you do this day after day? And you know, look, I love this country, and I feel blessed. I feel blessed, and I want everybody to have the same chance to go after your part of the American Dream, and I think the American Dream is big enough for everybody.\n\nI think a lot about my two grandchildren, because obviously, I would do anything to help them, but it's not just them. I want to help everybody's children and grandchildren, because the kind of country we will have when they become adults will be affected by the decisions we make now on education, on healthcare, on ending the epidemic of gun violence, on getting the cost of prescription drugs down, on preserving and protecting Social Security and Medicare, doing what we must to make sure we're passing on a country that provides the same level of opportunity to all who come after us.\n\nSo please join me. This is bigger than me, it's bigger than any of us. It's even bigger than Donald Trump, if you can believe it.\n\nThis is a crossroads election that's going to determine so much about what kind of country we have in the decades ahead. I want to wake up in the White House with your help, making it my mission to do everything I can to give every person, and particularly every child, the chance to live up to his or her God-given potential.\n\nIf you will stand with me, if you will work with me over the next two weeks, let's go out and build the kind of future we want for ourselves, for our kids, and let's prove once and for all that love trumps hate.\n\nThank you all very much.\u0000","62":"Thank you, Ohio. It is so great to be in the great city of Canton.\nWe just got new polls from Bloomberg and CNN. We're up five points in Ohio, and the LA Times poll has us up 5 points nationwide.\n\nThe people of the United States are ready for change. They're ready to discard a failed political establishment that disdains, disrespects and looks down on hardworking people.\n\nThis election is about a choice between the control of an arrogant ruling class in Washington D.C. versus the hopes and dreams of everyday citizens.\n\nFor years, our leaders have looked out only for themselves.\n\nThere is no greater example of this in our country than Flint, Michigan. The city of Flint was once known as Buick City. More than 80,000 workers were employed by GM in 1970 - today, its less than 8,000. Forty percent of the city's residents are living in poverty. Violent crime is among the nation's highest.\n\nToday I went to Flint, Michigan to address the water crisis. The water crisis in Flint demonstrates failure at every single level of government.\n\nIt's tragic and it's heartbreaking, and it should never happen in the United States of America.\n\nThis is the catastrophe that happens when we build up other countries instead of our own.\n\nIt used to be cars were made in Flint and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico. Now, the cars are made in Mexico and you can't drink the water in Flint.\n\nWe are going to turn this around. We are going to bring our jobs back and protect our people.\n\nDriving through the city you see the shuttered homes and businesses, the dilapidated infrastructure.\n\nThis is what our politicians have done to this city, this is what our politicians have done to America.\n\nBut nowhere has the pain been worse than our inner cities. Democratic politicians have ran our inner cities for 50, 60, 70 years. Their policies have produced massive poverty, joblessness, and failing schools.\n\nThey've trapped Americans in suffering for years, and I'm running to offer a better future. Lower crime, better schools, more jobs - safety, security, opportunity.\n\nNow, I understand there are going to be some people in these communities who aren't planning on voting for me right now. I will campaign hard for their votes - we can't stay the course our country is on. If you keep voting for the same people, you'll keep getting the same results.\n\nI am willing to campaign anywhere. I am willing to go anywhere, visit anywhere, even if some voters openly oppose me in a community I will go there and ask them for their support.\n\nHillary Clinton calls people who aren't supporting her deplorable and irredeemable. I call people who aren't supporting me American citizens who are entitled to the same respect as anyone else - and I will not stop campaigning for every last American vote, in every last American community, right up until November 8th.\n\nI will take my message to communities that are 99% Democrat, or that have voted Democrat for generations. I am running to be President for all Americans, to represent all Americans, and to liberate our poorest citizens from crime and poverty and violence.\n\nThe economic policies of Hillary Clinton - on trade, on the economy, on immigration - have devastated the inner cities of America. Her policies are the problem; we are offering the solution.\n\nHillary Clinton believes in globalism - taking jobs from Flint and moving them to other countries. I am not running to be President of the world - I am running to be President of the United States. I am running to bring hope to Flint, to Canton, and to every party of this country.\n\nIf we don't break free from our partisan boxes, then nothing will ever change - it's time to vote for America and America First.\n\nHillary Clinton's refugee plans will cost $400 billion dollars in the long-term. That's enough money to rebuild the entire water infrastructure of the United States.\n\nPresident Obama just announced a 30% increase to refugee admissions, bringing the total to 110,000 refugees in just one single year.\n\nInstead of providing free healthcare and jobs to millions of refugees, we need to rebuild our inner cities and take care of Americans.\n\nOur support comes from every part of America, and every walk of life. You are cops and soldiers; mechanics and accountants; young and the old; black, white and Latino. You are moms and dads, children and grandparents, you are from cities small and large and in-between. But above everything else, you are all Americans.\n\nHillary Clinton's attacks on you display the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as Secretary of State, hide and delete her emails, destroy her phones with a hammer, put classified information in the reach of our enemies, lie to Congress, and sell government favors and access through the Clinton Foundation.\n\nNow the people who destroyed the emails are all pleading the fifth amendment in front of Congress.\n\nThere is no greater threat to Democracy than when a public official puts their office up for sale. Look at what she did with Russian Uranium, or with UBS bank, or with the contracts in Haiti.\n\nHillary Clinton's record as Secretary of State is one of historic failure. Just look at what she did to the Middle East - in Iraq, in Syria, in Libya. Not to mention her failures in Russia, China and North Korea.\n\nOne failure after another - all while raising millions and millions from her friends in Wall Street.\n\nThe policies of Hillary Clinton have produced only destruction overseas and poverty at home.\n\n1 in 5 American households do not have a single member in the labor force. Another 14 million people left the labor force entirely since 2009. And the national debt has doubled.\n\nI am running to reverse these policies, and to create a future of prosperity for all Americans.\n\nMy economic agenda can be summed up in three words: jobs, jobs, jobs.\n\nThat begins with a new America-First trade policy.\n\nHillary Clinton's bad judgement was seen in her support for Bill Clinton's NAFTA, her support for China's entry into the World Trade Organization, and her support for the TPP - she called it the \"Gold Standard.\"\n\nOhio has lost nearly 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, and 1 in 4 since China entered the WTO.\n\nOur trade deficit in goods with the world is now nearly $800 billion dollars.\n\nI will renegotiate NAFTA, I will defend your jobs, and I will bring back vehicle production to the United States of America.\n\nAmerica's trade deficit with the proposed TPP member countries cost the state of Ohio more than 100,000 manufacturing jobs last year. Imagine how many more jobs would be lost if TPP was actually approved - which Hillary Clinton 100% would do if she ever got the chance.\n\nWe won't let that happen. But you have to get out and vote.\n\nMy first day in office, I am also going to order a review of every single regulation issued over the last eight years. All needless, job-killing regulations will be cancelled. Millions of new jobs will come pouring in.\n\nWe are going to lift the restrictions on American energy.\n\nAlso on my first day, I am going to ask Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare.\n\nI will fight for you against the special interests, against the corrupt politicians, and against the powerful insiders. Let me be your champion.\n\nIn all things, it's time to put Americans first - and start taking care of each other.\n\nYesterday, I rolled out a plan to help our mothers and our families get affordable, quality childcare for their children.\n\nOn policy after policy, we are going to bring opportunity and prosperity to all Americans.\n\nI am going to lower you taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations, on business and in your life; I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare; I'm going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution; I'm going to rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; I'm going to save your 2nd amendment ; I'm going to stop illegal immigration and drugs coming into our country, and yes, we will build the wall ; and I'm going to, so importantly, renegotiate your horrible trade deals, especially NAFTA - which is the single worst trade deal ever made by any country anywhere in the world and a one-way street for jobs out of the United States - and we will make great trade deals that put the American worker first.\n\nAnd Apple, and our other major companies, will start making their iPhones, computers and other products inside of the United States - not in China, and all over the world.\n\nWe don't make our products anymore in the United States, but we will again - like never before.\n\nWe will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals. We will rebuild our water infrastructure, and our EPA will abandon political agendas and focus on its core mission: clean air and safe water.\n\nAmerican cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.\n\nAmerican steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.\n\nAmerican hands will rebuild this nation - and American energy, mined from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.\n\nWe will put new American steel into the spine of this country.\n\nI will fight for every neglected part of this nation - and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.\n\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\n\nIt is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.\n\nJobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores.\n\nOnce more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.\n\nWe Will Make America Wealthy Again.\n\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\n\nAnd Will Make America Great Again.\n\nThank you, and God Bless!\u0000","63":"Thank you. I am so thrilled to be back in Washington.\nTogether, we are going to work hard over the next 70 days and we are going to win this state - and we are going to win the White House.\n\nIt's going to be a victory for the people. A victory for the everyday citizen whose voice hasn't been heard.\n\nIt will be a win for the voters - not the pundits, not the journalists, not the lobbyists, not the global special interests funding my opponent's campaign.\n\nThis is going to be YOUR victory.\n\nWe are going to create the New American Future our children deserve.\n\nIn this new future, millions of workers on the sidelines will be returned to the workforce.\n\nCrumbling roads, bridges and airports will be replaced with the infrastructure our country needs and deserves.\n\nFamilies trapped in welfare will be provided with jobs and opportunity.\n\nGovernment will become lean, effective, responsible - and honest.\n\nOur border will be protected, and our children will be safe.\n\nWe will rebuild our inner cities, and provide safety and peace to all of our citizens.\n\nAmerican values and culture will be cherished and celebrated once again.\n\nBut to achieve this future, we must break free from the bitter failures of the past - and reject the same insiders telling us the same old lies.\n\nOne area where honesty is badly needed is on the subject of economic and living conditions for African-American citizens in the United States.\n\nMillions of African-Americans in this country have succeeded greatly, and their contributions to every area of our life - now and throughout our history - should be celebrated and cherished. This includes the amazing achievements in art, science, sport, music, medicine, business and so much else. This includes millions of African-American entrepreneurs, innovators and the millions of African-American workers in our middle class.\n\nBut we must also talk about those who have been left behind, the millions suffering in disastrous conditions in so many of our inner cities - and neighborhoods afflicted by poverty, drugs, and violence.\n\nNo group in America has been more harmed by Hillary Clinton's policies than African-Americans.\n\nThere is no better evidence of this fact than Hillary Clinton's immigration policy, which brings in illegal immigrants and refugees to take jobs from hardworking African-American and Hispanic citizens.\n\nInstead of providing free healthcare and jobs to millions of refugees from around the world, we should rebuild our inner cities and provide jobs to struggling Americans.\n\nTonight, I am asking for the vote of every African-American and Hispanic citizen in this country who wants a better future.\n\nThe inner cities of our country have been run by the Democratic Party for fifty, sixty, seventy years.\n\nThese Democratic policies - the policies of Hillary Clinton - have produced only poverty, joblessness, failing schools, broken homes, and rising crime.\n\nNearly 4 in 10 African-American children live in poverty, including 45% of children under the age of six. 58% of African-American youth are not working. Meanwhile, another 2 million Hispanic-Americans have been added to the ranks of those in poverty since 2009.\n\nIn Detroit, half of all its residents do not work. In Milwaukee, almost 4 in 10 African-American men between the ages of 24-54 do not have a job.\n\nHere, in the state of Washington, 65% of Latino children and 60% of African-American children live in low-income households.\n\nChicago just had the most violent month in 20 years. More than 2,800 have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.\n\nIt breaks our hearts.\n\nWe cannot let this violence continue. It must be ended.\n\nUnder A Trump Administration, it will be ended.\n\nIt will be my priority to work with communities, local police, state police and federal law enforcement to dismantle the gangs and to liberate our citizens from violence and poverty and fear. I will appoint the best judges and prosecutors and federal investigators who will make this their personal mission.\n\nThere is one thing which can no longer be denied: if you keep voting for the same people, you will keep getting the same results. To those suffering, I say: what do you have to lose by voting for Donald Trump? I will fix it. I will fight for you as no one ever has before.\n\nLet me also tell you what you have to gain: jobs, opportunity, security, and safety.\n\nThis means so much to me.\n\nI believe every child in this country - in Detroit, in Baltimore, in Chicago - has the right to live out their lives in safety and peace.\n\nIn the Wall Street Journal, Heather Mac Donald of the Manhattan Institute just wrote an important article about the soaring crime in our inner cities, and the responsibility of Democratic politicians for creating this problem.\n\nThe article is called: \"Black Lives Matter to Donald Trump.\" McDonald writes that \"Mr. Trump's call to restore law and order recognizes the right of inner-city residents to enjoy the same freedom from fear that the rest of America now takes for granted.\"\n\nFreedom from violence is one of the great civil rights issues of our time. So too is the issue of school choice.\n\nWe will fight for the right of parents to send their kids to the school that they believe gives their kids the best shot at success.\n\nI will not accept a future in which children of any color in this country are not fully included in the American Dream. Our whole country loses when we leave millions of talented, aspiring Americans on the sidelines. We want to give everyone a chance to contribute their full talents to our economy and our country.\n\nRemember: the Republican Party is the Party of Lincoln, the party of freedom, equality and opportunity. It is the Democratic Party that is the party of slavery, the party of Jim Crow, the party of oppression.\n\nNothing makes me more honored and proud than to be the nominee of Abraham Lincoln's Republican Party.\n\nOur party will fight to bring hope to every forgotten stretch of this country.\n\nOnce again, we will be One American Nation.\n\nOne United People.\n\nAnd we will have One Great Future.\n\nThat great future will be built on these three critical words: jobs, jobs, jobs.\n\nThis will include a complete revitalization of our manufacturing sector, which has been so badly hurt by Hillary Clinton's policies.\n\nWe are bringing the jobs back to our country.\n\nWe are going to renegotiate NAFTA, keep out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, stand up to China, and fight for every last American job.\n\nThe destruction that NAFTA started will be finished off if the Trans-Pacific Partnership is approved.\n\nThat would be a disaster. We won't let it happen.\n\nBut that's just the beginning of what we are going to do for American workers.\n\nOn taxes, we are going to provide massive tax relief to all working people, and lower the tax rate on small business from 35% down to 15%. Low and middle-income parents will also be able to fully deduct the average cost of childcare from their taxes.\n\nOn regulations, I am going to direct every agency and Department Head in my government to identify all needless and job-killing regulations and they will be removed. We will have a temporary moratorium on new regulations to allow our economy to grow and thrive.\n\nEconomic growth for last quarter has been revised down to 1.1%, a total disaster. Meanwhile, our trade deficit in goods with the world is now nearly $800 billion dollars.\n\nWe will further bring back our jobs by unleashing an American energy revolution - lifting restrictions on oil, coal, natural gas and all sources of American energy. This will create millions of jobs and lower the price of energy for all families.\n\nWe are also going to secure our border to stop the drugs from pouring in. The Seattle-area recently experienced the largest number of heroin-related deaths in 20 years. We have to stop the drugs poisoning our communities.\n\nAnother major issue in this race is foreign policy. Hillary Clinton has made one bad foreign policy decision after another - beginning with her support for going to war in Iraq in the first place, which I opposed.\n\nHer tenure as Secretary of State may be regarded as the most disastrous in U.S. history.\n\nLook at the world before and after she became Secretary of State.\n\nPre-Hillary, in early 2009, Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence.\n\nLibya was stable.\n\nSyria was under control.\n\nThe group we know today as ISIS was close to being extinguished.\n\nIran was being choked by sanctions.\n\nNow, fast-forward to present time.\n\nAfter Hillary, here is what the world looks like:\n\nIraq is in total chaos.\n\nSyria is in the midst of a disastrous civil war and a refugee crisis now threatens Europe and the United States.\n\nISIS has been unleashed onto the entire world.\n\nIran - the world's top state sponsor of terrorism - has been put on the path to nuclear weapons, and was given a $400 million dollar cash ransom payment.\n\nThis is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction and terrorism.\n\nAmerica deserves a better legacy.\n\nAll of you deserve a better future. I am the change agent.\n\nHillary Clinton is the defender of the status quo.\n\nWhile our country lost badly under Hillary Clinton, she cashed in big time. Bill Clinton's speaking fees surged while Hillary was Secretary of State - Bill was paid almost $50 million dollars for speeches during her tenure, an increase of 44% over the previous 4 years.\n\nThen there was all the money funneled into the Clinton Foundation from foreign governments and corporations.\n\nIt was pay-for-play. Just look at what she did with UBS, or the Russian Uranium, or disaster relief in Haiti, and so many other examples.\n\nBut the only way to learn the full depth of her public corruption is to read the 33,000 emails she deleted.\n\nHillary Clinton said under oath that she turned over all of her work-related emails. But we know that is one more Clinton lie. The FBI found thousands of work-related emails she never turned over, and then another 15,000 emails were just discovered a few weeks ago.\n\nNow, today, another 30 emails were discovered by the State Department that Hillary Clinton failed to turn over - these were emails about Benghazi.\n\nIt just never ends with the Clintons.\n\nThere is only one way to get justice in this rigged system and that is to show up and vote on November 8th - and to vote big.\n\nIn A Trump Administration, the State Department will work for the country - not for Hillary Clinton's donors.\n\nUnder Hillary Clinton, it's the powerful protecting the powerful.\n\nPoliticians defending politicians.\n\nInsiders fighting for insiders.\n\nI am fighting for you.\n\nThe government will work for citizens once again.\n\nThe era of division will be replaced with a future of unity.\n\nWe are going to do it by emphasizing what we all have in common. We will proudly promote our culture as Americans, the best in the world.\n\nIt is time to break with the failures of the past, and to fight for every last child in this country to have the better future they deserve.\n\nThis is the change I am promising all of you: an honest government, a thriving economy, and a just society for each and every American.\n\nI am asking for your vote so I can be your champion in the White House.\n\nTogether, We Will Make America Wealthy Again.\n\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\n\nWe Will Make America Proud Again.\n\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\n\nAnd We Will Make America Great Again.\n\nThank you, and God Bless.\u0000","64":"Hello Grand Valley! Thank you! Thank you.\nIt is great to be back in western Michigan. Thank you. Are there any Lakers here?\n\nOh, my gosh. I am so thrilled to be here. I want to thank the president of this great university, Tom Haas, the faculty, the staff, the students. I want to thank Brandon Dillon, the Chair of the Michigan Democratic Party. And I especially really want to thank you for sending Debbie Stabenow to the United States Senate.\n\nI have also the great personal experience and privilege of having worked with Debbie, gotten to know her, become a friend of hers, and I am so excited at the possibility that I'll be able to work with her again. But I want you to know this - and I really, really hope you'll tell folks, because there is no more dedicated, effective member of the United States Senate than Debbie Stabenow.\n\nShe fights for all of you every day, but she does it with that smile that never leaves her face. And she brings people together who are on opposite sides of issues because she just keeps talking. And don't we need more of that in Washington where people actually talk and listen to each other. So it's wonderful to be with all of you and to be introduced by Debbie.\n\nAre you ready to vote tomorrow, Michigan? Are you ready to help get your friends to vote tomorrow? That is clearly the right answer because we have a really important election tomorrow.\n\nThe choice in this election could not be clearer. And I know that for many people, you've gone back and forth, you've thought about what to do, and I really respect that. But let me say this. Let me say this. This election is basically between division and unity in our country.\n\nIt's between strong and steady leadership or a loose cannon who could put everything at risk. It is between an economy that works for everyone or one that is even more stacked for those at the top. And I want each and every one of you to be thinking through about all the issues that you care about. Because although my name and my opponents name will be on the ballot, those issues, and those values, are on the ballot as well.\n\nAnd as you think about what you care about and what you want your future to look like you have to recognize this is a consequential election. I have been privileged to know a lot of our presidents over the past decades, and people who ran for president. I was privileged to know as a college student, Gerald Ford.\n\nIn fact, I had an internship with the House Republican Conference Committee, which he headed, after my junior year in college. So when I say I've gotten to know a lot of our presidents, and people who've run for president, it goes back a ways. And here's what I want you to understand. I didn't agree with everything they did or said. Even the Democrats. We had differences and politics and policies and sometimes on principle, but I never doubted, I never doubted that they were fit to serve as our president and commander-in-chief.\n\nThat's why this election is so different. And it's why so many Republicans have spoken out to endorse me and support me, and who have taken very courageous stands against the nominee of their own party. Because they believe that we must put country ahead of party when it comes to this election.\n\nI was at Kent State, in Ohio, last week and I was introduced by a gentleman by the name of Bruce Blair. And Mr. Blair had served in the Air Force, he was a young officer assigned to be what was called a launch officer. That meant he served his time every day sitting in a bunker where the controls for launching nuclear weapons were housed. And his job - imagine the responsibility. A young Air Force officer in his twenties, waiting to hear whether or not an order is given for him to launch nuclear weapons.\n\nAnd Bruce Blair explained that there is no appeal from a president's order to do that. The joint chiefs of our military forces can't say, \"No, don't do it.\" There's no veto from Congress or anyone else. And the time between the order being given and the actual launch is four minutes.\n\nSo after watching this election Mr. Blair began contacting others who had served in this incredibly responsible position to share his concerns about what he was hearing and seeing. And several dozen of them - I'd never met them before - several dozen of them wrote a letter explaining why they could never support Donald Trump to be our commander-in-chief.\n\nThe awesome responsibility that is housed in one person is something I want you to think about between now and the time you vote. Because I will pledge to you that I will exercise the greatest care and responsibility in all of the powers invested in the office of the presidency.\n\nI also want to pose to you a contrast in visions. Did any of you see the debates? First of all, I did stand for four and a half hours with Donald Trump on the stage, proving conclusively I have the stamina to be president.\n\nBut I have to say, in addition to that, there were so many things that he said that of course I sometimes was surprised by. But the theme that ran through much of his rhetoric was the presentation of a dark and divisive vision for America. Now I have to tell you, I know we've got problems. I've spent 18 months traveling around our country talking to - by now - hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people, hearing what's on people's minds. We've got challenges but America's always had challenges. And since when do we become pessimistic and not able to think about what we can do to overcome those challenges and solve those problems together?\n\nI often didn't recognize the country that Donald Trump was describing. Because from my perspective, looking back at our history, we have a tremendous opportunity ahead of us. And you can vote for a hopeful, inclusive, big-hearted America that will set the stage for an even better future.\n\nAnd I want to say especially to the students who are here - I really believe that America's best days are still ahead of us if we reach for them together.\n\nMake no mistake. Our core values are being tested in this election. But my faith in our future has never been stronger. Last night in Manchester, New Hampshire, I was introduced by Mr. Khizr Khan.\n\nSome of you know or remember that his son, Captain Khan, serving in the United States Army, was killed serving in Iraq. And like at the Democratic Convention this summer, he spoke powerfully about what America means to him. And how we have to defend our values and our Constitution that are the envy of the rest of the world. People look at us with yearning. They see that we are a beacon of freedom, hope and opportunity for people, right here, at home.\n\nWhen I heard Mr. Khan speak at the convention, and I heard him again last night, I was so touched because what he said exhibited a love of our country. He said that when he started hearing Donald Trump speak, and all of the things he said about so many people, not only Muslims but African-Americans and Latinos and POWs and women and so many people - when he heard it he couldn't help but think as he walked around his house - he has a room where his son's medals - he got the Bronze Star, he got the Purple Heart - the flag that was draped on his coffin - is respectfully presented in the box that he was given it in. And he thought to himself, \"Would there be any room for my son in Donald Trump's America?\"\n\nThink about that for a minute. Because every single one of us has something to contribute. To this great country. We are already great but we can be greater. And we will be greater.\n\nI love our country and I believe in the American people, and I know there is nothing we can't do when we make up our minds. Throughout our history, generations of Americans have risen together to meet the tests of their time. They defended democracy. They built the greatest middle class the world has ever known. They marched for civil rights and voting rights, for workers' rights and union rights, for LGBT rights, rights for people with disabilities.\n\nAnd now, now we've got to come together and we have to prove we can meet the chal-lenges of our time. We've got to get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top.\n\nIf you believe, as I do, that America thrives when the middle class thrives, then you have to vote tomorrow.\n\nWe are going to make the biggest investment in good paying jobs since World War II. Jobs in infrastructure. Our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports, our water systems.\n\nThese are jobs we need doing in American and these are jobs that cannot be exported. They've got to be done right here in Michigan and across our country.\n\nAnd we are going to invest in new jobs in advanced manufacturing. I am not one of these folks who think, \"We just can't make it in America anymore.\" And I'll tell you why. Because if we have a plan and we actually commit to fulfilling that plan, we can lead the world in precision machining, in 3-D printing. We're not competing for low-wage jobs, we're competing with Germany for high manufacturing, high- skilled jobs.\n\nAnd we are going to have clean, renewable energy jobs as a way to fight climate change. As you heard, my opponent chose to make many of his products overseas. And as I pointed out in the last debate, he buys cheap Chinese steel and aluminum instead of good American steel, made by American steel workers.\n\nHe's gone all over this country, and he's gone all over Michigan, talking about how he's gonna really get more jobs and he's going to bring back what used to be there. Well I'll tell you what. Look at his record, don't just listen to his rhetoric.\n\nBecause I have a different idea. We're going to invest in America again. And for every-body who is frustrated, and anxious, and maybe even angry because they feel left out, left behind, that America's not working the way it should - I understand that. I under-stand that. I represented upstate New York for eight years, and I saw first hand a lot of the loss of jobs and factories, picking up and moving out.\n\nBut I also realized that anger is not a plan. You've got to come together and figure out what is it we're gonna do to bring new jobs back and create more opportunity for people.\n\nAnd I'll just tell you that I believe that we've got to defend the American worker's right to organize and bargain for better wages and benefits.\n\nWe're gonna get incomes rising here in western Michigan and across this state. And we're also gonna do more to help small business. My dad was a small businessman. He worked really hard. He ran a printing plant that printed fabrics for draperies, and I would from time to time help him out. You take a silkscreen, you put it down on the long table, you pour the paint in, you do the squeegee, you pick it up - it wasn't automated, we were the automaters - and you'd go all the way down to one table, you'd go to the other table. So I know how hard people in small business work.\n\nAnd I also know something else. Donald Trump made a lot of money off the backs of small business people and contractors by stiffing them and refusing to pay his bills. And I have said, \"I am sure glad my dad never got a contract from Donald Trump, because we could not have afforded that.\"\n\nBut it's not just enough to grow the economy. We have to make it fairer. And if you believe we need a fairer economy then you have to vote. I think the best antidote for whatever ails a person is a good job. I believe in hard work. That's how I was raised. But I also believe that if you work hard and you work full time you shouldn't still be in poverty at the end of the year. And I'm gonna raise the national minimum wage.\n\nAnd one of the things I've heard all over America, especially from young families, really from all families but particularly young families, is how hard it is to do so many of the things that are expected - like where do you find affordable quality childcare? In lots of states, it's more expensive than college tuition. We're gonna get the cost of childcare down. We're going to have a paid family leave program so that when you have a sick relative or you're sick you won't lose your job.\n\nI saw the folks over there holding up the Tim Kaine sign and I really appreciate that. Thank you. Thank you. I got to tell you - Tim and I were in Pittsburgh last month, with a big crowd, and we couldn't get everybody in, like today, so Tim went out to say hello to people and he saw a woman holding a baby, probably about three years old. And he stopped to talk to her and she said, \"I came here because I wanted to tell you, and to tell Hillary Clinton, what happened to me.\" She said that, \"I had my baby, it was a hard labor and delivery and I needed some time off. And I called by boss and said the doctors want me to take some time off and so I won't be in for - I think she said two weeks - and they said, \"OK. You're fired.\"\n\nThat is legal in America, still. And what that does is to say that - wait a minute, do we really value children? Do we really value families? And we've got to have a system that is fair to employers and fair to employees because you got to be able to balance work and family in today's America.\n\nAnd then finally, I think it is way past time to guarantee equal pay for women's work.\n\nAnd you know I gotta say - this always gets a huge round of applause, as you can tell - but this is not just a woman's issue. It's a family issue. If you have a wife, a mother, a sister, a daughter, who's in the work force, you want her to be paid what she deserves to be paid to help you and your family.\n\nJust about everything I've said so far my opponent disagrees with. And whenever I talk about affordable childcare, and paid family leave, and equal pay - he says I'm playing the woman's card and you know what I say, if that's the case? Then deal me in.\n\nAnd here's what else I want you to know. It's fair to ask, \"How are you going to pay for that?\" That's not only fair, that's necessary to ask. Because I want to be a good steward of your tax dollars just as I expect you're a good steward of your family budget. I have proposed a very simple formula. I will not raise taxes on anyone making less than $250,000 a year.\n\nAnd for small businesses, we're gonna cut your taxes because I know a lot of small businesses need that kind of tax relief. So instead, we're going where the money is, to the millionaires and the billionaires and the big corporations.\n\nAnd that is in stark contrast to what Donald Trump has proposed. His whole economic plan is cut trillions of dollars in taxes from millionaires and billionaires and corporations. That is trickle-down economics on steroids. I profoundly disagree. I think the way you build an economy is from the middle out and the bottom up, not from the top down.\n\nWhen you think about it, Donald hasn't paid anything for 20 years. He's paid zero to support our military, our vets, Pell grants for students here at Grand Valley, our high-ways - and I am still pondering, I am just pondering how anybody can lose a billion dollars in one year.\n\nEspecially when you're running casinos. I do not understand that. But that will be one of the mysteries in this campaign because he's not going to release his tax returns now and the time you start voting. And that sort of suggests there must be something really terrible in those tax returns because everybody else for more than 40 years has released them.\n\nSo, we'll still wonder. But what we know is his economic approach will cost us jobs, not create jobs. And we can't afford that. We need to keep building. We have recovered from the worst financial crash since the Great Depression but we're not where we need to be yet. The last thing we need is a failed economic policy coming back in and pushing us back down. And depriving people of the jobs that we want to create.\n\nAnd if you believe all of our kids should have good schools and good teachers no matter what zip code they live in then you have to vote.\n\nAnd if you believe college should be affordable you have to vote. I've got to say I am proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran. It was a campaign about ideas and issues, not insults. And when it was over, we actually got together. What a novel idea. We wanted to figure out how we can work together to actually produce on some of the goals that we both shared. So Bernie and I worked on this plan together.\n\nPublic colleges and universities should be tuition-free for everyone who makes less than a $125,000 a year. And they should be debt-free for everyone else because nobody should go into debt. And if you have gone into debt, if you're among the millions of Americans who are struggling - as I see some hands pointing in the air - paying back your student debt, we are going to help you pay it down and pay it off.\n\nIt makes no sense at all. We have interest rates that are really low right now. Buy a car for what, 1 or 2 percent. You can buy a house for 3,4 percent. There are so many people who are paying 8, 10, 12, higher - 8, 10, 12 percent interest - how much? Twelve point seven. Fourteen point one. I got to tell you friends. That is outrageous. The federal government should not be making money off of sending kids to college.\n\nI can't wait to roll up my sleeves with Debbie and Bernie and we're gonna get to work right after this election if I am fortunate enough to win.\n\nLook. Working for children and families has been the cause of my life, but it's never been more important than it is right now. And that has to be our mission together. Doing all we can to help every American, and especially every young American and every child in America to have the chance to live up to their God-given potential. I will wake up every single day in the White House trying to figure out what I can do to make that a reality for you.\n\nSo after tomorrow the work will begin, and one of the highest priorities that I feel an obligation to address is how we bring our country together. A lot of people say we've got to heal our country, or as the Bible says repair the breach. Because we have so much divisiveness right now. We've got to start listening to each other. Respecting each other. I know it is unusual, I admit, for somebody running for president, especially the day before an election, but I've been saying this for months. To say that we need more of two things right now.\n\nWe need more love and kindness in America.\n\nI don't know about you, I don't know about you but I bet everyone of us has received a kindness and maybe, I hope, we've all extended one. I am standing here today because my mother, who was abandoned by her parents, rejected by her grandparents, went to work at the age of 14 as a maid, and a babysitter, was extended kindness. Not by those who should have loved her, but by others. The first grade teacher who saw she had nothing to eat at lunch, who began bringing extra food. The woman whose house she went to work in who knew that my mother wanted to go to high school. She would have been a freshman in high school when she had to leave her grandparents' home and she got this job. And that woman said, \"I know you want to go to high school. If you get up early and you get your chores done, you can go to high school, but you'll have to come back because we'll need you in the late afternoon.\"\n\nNow that may sound harsh to say to a 14-year old but to my mother it was a gift. I tell you this because we all have to start thinking about how we want to be treated and what that means about how we treat others. And \u00c3\u0089\n\nThere's a version of the golden rule in every major religion. And it is a reminder that every one of us gets knocked down. The question as my mother would say is are you gonna get back up? And for people in our country who feel like they've been knocked down and nobody cares, nobody's paying attention, here's what I want you to know. If you give me the honor of being your president I'm gonna do everything I can to get this country and everybody in it back up on our feet moving forward together.\n\nBecause I want to be a president for all Americans.\n\nDemocrats, Republicans, Independents. Not just the people who support me, everybody in this country. Because I believe with all my heart each of us has a role to play in building a better future. So let's take that first step tomorrow. If you don't know where you're supposed to vote go to iwillvote.com - you can get all the information you need. If you want to help us bringing out the vote here in western Michigan in the last 24, 36 hours, you can still sign up to volunteer. Go to hillaryclinton.com. Or you can text join247246 or stop by one of our offices. We would be really excited to see you, because when your kids and grandkids ask what you did in 2016, when everything was on the line, I hope you'll be able to say that you voted for a better, stronger, fairer America.\n\nAn America where we build bridges, not walls.And an America where we prove that yes, love trumps hate.\n\nThank you all so much.\u0000","65":"Hello, B-W-A. I thank you all for that warm welcome. There's nowhere I'd rather be than right here with all of you this morning.\nPlease everyone be seated. This is such a great opportunity to lift up the work that so many of you have done for years -- your organizations, individually -- and I am grateful for it because it has helped to guide me in a lot of the work that I've been privileged to do.\n\nI want to thank Gwen Hess for her introduction. I want to acknowledge, it's always great to see a woman serve as president in any setting.\n\nI want to congratulate today's honorees. Everyone is so deserving of this recognition. I also want to acknowledge a few others. We have some fierce members of Congress with us today, women whom I admire, who have been my colleagues and friends and with whom I am looking forward to continuing our work: Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, Congresswoman Gwen Moore, Congresswoman Yvette Clarke, Congresswoman Stacey Plaskett.\n\nAnd I want to give a special shout out to Congresswoman Joyce Beatty. When I saw Joyce recently, she said, 'Well, you are coming, aren't you?' And I said, 'I'm working hard to get it set.' And I am so proud that it did work out, and I thank Joyce for that extra push.\n\nI also want to acknowledge someone who had such a profound effect on my life, in every way, someone whom I admire and love, Marian Wright Edelman. This audience is filled with longtime friends and people I went to Wellesley College with that became life-long friends to me, and so many of you who have been on the front lines -- everyone associated with The Black Women's Agenda, I'm thrilled to be with you. I'm thrilled to be associated with you. I'm also thrilled to be back on the campaign trail. As the world knows, I was a little under the weather recently. The good news is, my pneumonia finally got some Republicans interested in women's health.\n\nLooking back, I know, I should have followed my doctor's orders to rest, but, my instinct was to push through it. That is what women do every single day, and I felt no different. Life has shown us that we do have to work harder at the office while still bearing most of the responsibilities at home -- that we always need to keep going because our families and our communities count on us. And I think it is more than fair to say, that black women have an even tougher road.\n\nAnd you, your daughters, your granddaughters -- I was pleased to meet Gwen's beautiful granddaughter earlier -- leave the house every morning, put on that game face that we all practice, and enter a society that consistently challenges your worth. With the images you see, the lower pay that so many take home, that try to silence your voices and break your spirits; yet, you remain fierce in the face of these challenges. We see that every day in the businesses you start, the art you create, the children you teach and the communities and organizations you lead. While your stories are often missing from the history books -- make no mistake -- you are the change makers, the path breakers, and the ground shakers. And, you are proof that yes, indeed, black girl magic is real.\n\nNow, I've been blessed to see this magic's influence on kids and communities up close for decades, starting with my first job after law school working with Marian at the Children's Defense Fund. Marian's belief was that every single child had worth and potential and deserved the opportunity to live up to their god potential with the tools and the support that every child needs. And that if we just improve the odds a bit for those suffering in poverty, they could flourish. So she led our team into some very poor communities. We met kids who had dropped out of school because they couldn't afford textbooks or transportation. Some didn't have decent clothes and stayed home to avoid being humiliated in class. Some had untreated medical and dental problems that made it practically impossible for them to learn. Those stories really hurt my heart.\n\nBut Marian always believed we could deliver help and hope if we never ever gave up. So she taught us ways to think creatively, as well as strategically-- to take our advocacy and turn it into action and results. She sent me to New Bedford, Massachusetts, to go door to door looking for children who weren't in school. That was back before we had a legal requirement that every child, regardless of disability, deserved to get an education. I met a young girl in New Bedford and sat and talked with her on the small back porch of her house. She told me how badly she wanted to learn, but couldn't because schools weren't accessible or welcoming. So Marian had us get to work and change that.\n\nWe gathered evidence and built a coalition. We helped convince Congress to ensure access to education for all students with disabilities. Marian showed me that to drive real progress, you have to change both hearts and laws. You need both understanding and action. And there is no question, I'm here today because of her example. I also want to recognize pioneers like Barbara Jordan and Shirley Chisholm, who sacrificed and struggled so that I and so many other women running for office could soar. I'm here because of friends and colleagues, like Donna Brazile, Reverend Leah Daugherty and Congresswoman Marcia Fudge \u00c3\u0091 three black women who ran the Democratic National Convention in July. It was a great four days.\n\nIt goes to show that black women deserve more than a seat at the table. It's past time you had a fair chance to run the meeting. And let's be clear: I would not be the Demo-cratic nominee for President of the United States were it not for black women like all of you who made noise at the polls this year in support of our campaign -- who did surrogate events, went to barber shops and beauty salons and cafes, got on local radio and local TV to make the case. We've come far together.\n\nAnd as I said yesterday in North Carolina, I'm going to close my campaign the way I began my career all those years ago at the Children's Defense Fund, and the way that I will serve as your president should I have the great honor of being elected: I will be focused on opportunities for kids and fairness for families. The American people deserve something to vote for, not just against.\n\nAnd together -- together, we are going to make this a freer, fairer and stronger nation.\n\nWe're going to fight for the parents struggling to balance family and work and push for affordable child care, paid family leave, and yes, finally, equal pay for women.\n\nWe'll fight for the young girls who want a fair chance in life, which is why we'll make universal pre-k available so that every child -- no matter what they look like or where they live -- can rise up and be prepared to fulfill their academic destiny.\n\nWe are also going to do a lot to emphasize STEM education, particularly for girls and women, and I thank the agenda for making that a priority!\n\nWe'll fight for the entrepreneur who said that more businesses die in the parking lots of banks than anywhere else, which is why we're going to increase access to capital, and we are going to help African American women continue to represent the fastest growing segment of women-owned businesses in America right now.\n\nWe are going to invest in communities that have been left out and left behind. Urban reinvestment and restructuring that is going to give more people decent housing, access to jobs, the transportation to get to those jobs, rural communities that are too often ignored and denied the services they need. I am a fan of Jim Clyburn's '10-20-30' plan. I am going to do everything I can to push that forward.\n\nWe'll remember the pain of the Mothers of the Movement and fight for a criminal justice system that actually delivers justice and a future where everyone has respect for the law and is respected by the law. And we are going to pass common-sense reforms to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people and keep our communities safe.\n\nWe'll remember the families neglected in Flint and take action so that no child's life is ever put at risk again when brushing their teeth or drinking a glass of water at din-ner. We'll advocate for everyone concerned about their parents and grandparents as they age, and lift up caregivers and home care workers so older Americans can live in comfort and with dignity.\n\nAnd we're going to protect and enhance Social Security, which is the main source of income for older women. We'll stand-by-side to make sure that all of our rights are respected and protected - civil rights and women's rights, LGBT rights, worker's rights and, of course, voting rights.\n\nWe are coming together at a pivotal moment for our country. Now I do believe that every election is important. But this one feels different, doesn't it? That's because it is. The next 53 days will shape the next 50 years. The future of our children and grandchildren hangs in the balance.\n\nOn one hand, we have my opponent, Donald Trump, and in recent weeks, he's tried to restrain himself and clean up his image. But as Maya Angelou once said, 'When some-one shows you who they are, believe them the first time.' And we know who Donald is. For five years, he has led the birther movement to de-legitimize our first black president. His campaign was founded on this outrageous lie. There is no erasing it in history.\n\nJust yesterday, Trump again refused to say with his own words that the president was born in the United States. Donald's advisors had the temerity to say, 'He's doing the country a 'service' by pushing these lies.' No, he isn't. He's feeding into the worst im-pulses -- the bigotry and bias -- that lurks in our country.\n\nBarack Obama was born in America, plain and simple. And Donald Trump owes him and the American people an apology. So, my friends, there is no 'new' Donald Trump. There never will be. Donald Trump looks at President Obama after eight years as our president. He still doesn't see him as an American.\n\nThink of how dangerous that is. Imagine a person in the Oval Office who traffics in conspiracy theories and refuses to let them go - no matter what the facts are. Imagine someone who distorts the truth to fit a very narrow view of the world. Imagine a president who sees someone who doesn't look like him, and doesn't agree with him, and thinks, 'That person must not be a real American.'\n\nDonald Trump is unfit to be President of the United States. We cannot become insensitive to what he says and what he stirs up. We can't just accept this.We've got to stand up to it. If we don't, it won't stop.\n\nIn addition to the president, Donald Trump looks at a distinguished federal judge, born in Indiana, and he sees a Mexican, not an American. He looks at a Gold Star family and sees them as Muslims, not patriotic Americans. He looks at women and decides how our looks rate on a scale of one to 10. I look at America, I see everyone. I see our great diversity, which is one of our core strengths, not our burden. We know who Donald Trump is. Now it's time for our country to show who we are and reject his divisive vision.\n\nThat's why this election is so important. As Michelle Obama said at the Democratic Convention, 'When we go to the polls this November, the real choice isn't between a Democrat or Republican.' It's about who will have the power to shape our children's lives for the next four years. It's also about the kind of country we want to be, and what we want to leave behind for future generations.\n\nWe are at our best when every person gets to share in our nation's promise, contribute to its progress. 'Stronger Together' is not just our campaign slogan. It's the guiding principle for the future we need to build. So Americans, we need to ask themselves: Are we going to make our economy work for everyone or just for those at the top? Are we going to bring people together or pit Americans against each other and rip our country apart? Are we going to work with our allies to keep us safe or are we going to put a loose cannon in charge who would risk everything that generations of Americans have worked so hard to build?\n\nNow in many ways, the profound choice is up to the women in this room. African American women turned out to vote more than any other group of Americans in 2012. This year, once again, you have your hands on the wheel of history and you can write the next chapter of the American story.\n\nKeep up the great work with your Four for 4' campaign. Make sure we get as many people registered and then to the polls as we possibly can. People say to me all time, 'I just -- I don't know what to do about Trump and his supporters and the things he says and inciting violence and all of the terrible activities that are happening this election year.'\n\nWell, here's what we can do. Let's reject the cynicism, the bullying, the divisive rhetoric that my opponent uses to make us afraid of each other, afraid of our differences, afraid of our future. I know that all of us in this room are ready to stand up against this ... to rise up for our families, our communities, but most importantly, to show up at the polls this November.\n\nWith our power and strength, I know -- I believe this, or I would not be standing here before you, I would not have run again for president, I would not deal with all the in-coming brickbats that are hurled my way if I did not in my heart believe with every fiber of my being that together we can build a future where, yes, love trumps hate.\n\nThank you very much. Thank you.\u0000","66":"Wow. Thank you. That's a lot of people, Phoenix, that's a lot of people.\nThank you very much.\n\nThank you, Phoenix. I am so glad to be back in Arizona.\n\nThe state that has a very, very special place in my heart. I love people of Arizona and together we are going to win the White House in November.\n\nNow, you know this is where it all began for me. Remember that massive crowd also. So, I said let's go and have some fun tonight. We're going to Arizona, OK?\n\nThis will be a little bit different. This won't be a rally speech, per se. Instead, I'm going to deliver a detailed policy address on one of the greatest challenges facing our country today, illegal immigration.\n\nI've just landed having returned from a very important and special meeting with the President of Mexico, a man I like and respect very much. And a man who truly loves his country, Mexico.\n\nAnd, by the way, just like I am a man who loves my country, the United States.\n\nWe agree on the importance of ending the illegal flow of drugs, cash, guns, and people across our border, and to put the cartels out of business.\n\nWe also discussed the great contributions of Mexican-American citizens to our two countries, my love for the people of Mexico, and the leadership and friendship between Mexico and the United States. It was a thoughtful and substantive conversation and it will go on for awhile. And, in the end we're all going to win. Both countries, we're all going to win.\n\nThis is the first of what I expect will be many, many conversations. And, in a Trump administration we're going to go about creating a new relationship between our two countries, but it's going to be a fair relationship. We want fairness.\n\nBut to fix our immigration system, we must change our leadership in Washington and we must change it quickly.\n\nSadly, sadly there is no other way. The truth is our immigration system is worse than anybody ever realized. But the facts aren't known because the media won't report on them. The politicians won't talk about them and the special interests spend a lot of money trying to cover them up because they are making an absolute fortune. That's the way it is.\n\nToday, on a very complicated and very difficult subject, you will get the truth. The fundamental problem with the immigration system in our country is that it serves the needs of wealthy donors, political activists and powerful, powerful politicians. It's all you can do. Thank you. Thank you.\n\nLet me tell you who it does not serve. It does not serve you the American people. Doesn't serve you. When politicians talk about immigration reform, they usually mean the following, amnesty, open borders, lower wages. Immigration reform should mean something else entirely. It should mean improvements to our laws and policies to make life better for American citizens.\n\nThank you. But if we're going to make our immigration system work, then we have to be prepared to talk honestly and without fear about these important and very sensitive issues. For instance, we have to listen to the concerns that working people, our forgotten working people, have over the record pace of immigration and it's impact on their jobs, wages, housing, schools, tax bills and general living conditions.\n\nThese are valid concerns expressed by decent and patriotic citizens from all backgrounds, all over. We also have to be honest about the fact that not everyone who seeks to join our country will be able to successfully assimilate. Sometimes it's just not going to work out. It's our right, as a sovereign nation to chose immigrants that we think are the likeliest to thrive and flourish and love us.\n\nThen there is the issue of security. Countless innocent American lives have been stolen because our politicians have failed in their duty to secure our borders and enforce our laws like they have to be enforced. I have met with many of the great parents who lost their children to sanctuary cities and open borders. So many people, so many, many people. So sad. They will be joining me on this stage in a little while and I look forward to introducing, these are amazing, amazing people.\n\nCountless Americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this administration and the administration that causes this horrible, horrible thought process, called Hillary Clinton.\n\nThis includes incredible Americans like 21 year old Sarah Root. The man who killed her arrived at the border, entered Federal custody and then was released into the U.S., think of it, into the U.S. community under the policies of the White House Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Weak, weak policies. Weak and foolish policies.\n\nHe was released again after the crime, and now he's out there at large. Sarah had graduated from college with a 4.0, top student in her class one day before her death.\n\nAlso among the victims of the Obama-Clinton open borders policy was Grant Ronnebeck, a 21-year-old convenience store clerk and a really good guy from Mesa, Arizona. A lot of you have known about Grant.\n\nHe was murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted of burglary, who had also been released from federal custody, and they knew it was going to happen again.\n\nAnother victim is Kate Steinle. Gunned down in the sanctuary city of San Francisco, by an illegal immigrant, deported five previous times. And they knew he was no good.\n\nThen there is the case of 90-year-old Earl Olander, who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death in his home, 90 years old and defenseless. The perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records a mile long, who did not meet Obama administration standards for removal. And they knew it was going to happen.\n\nIn California, a 64-year-old Air Force veteran, a great woman, according to everybody that knew her, Marilyn Pharis, was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer. Her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions but was never, ever deported, despite the fact that everybody wanted him out.\n\nA 2011 report from the Government Accountability Office found that illegal immigrants and other non-citizens, in our prisons and jails together, had around 25,000 homicide arrests to their names, 25,000.\n\nOn top of that, illegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion dollars a year.\n\nAnd this is what we get. For the money we are going to spend on illegal immigration over the next 10 years, we could provide 1 million at-risk students with a school voucher, which so many people are wanting.\n\nWhile there are many illegal immigrants in our country who are good people, many, many, this doesn't change the fact that most illegal immigrants are lower skilled workers with less education, who compete directly against vulnerable American workers, and that these illegal workers draw much more out from the system than they can ever possibly pay back.\n\nAnd they're hurting a lot of our people that cannot get jobs under any circumstances.\n\nBut these facts are never reported. Instead, the media and my opponent discuss one thing and only one thing, the needs of people living here illegally. In many cases, by the way, they're treated better than our vets.\n\nNot going to happen anymore, folks. November 8th. Not going to happen anymore.\n\nThe truth is, the central issue is not the needs of the 11 million illegal immigrants or however many there may be -- and honestly we've been hearing that number for years. It's always 11 million.\n\nOur government has no idea. It could be 3 million. It could be 30 million. They have no idea what the number is.\n\nFrankly our government has no idea what they're doing on many, many fronts, folks.\n\nBut whatever the number, that's never really been the central issue. It will never be a central issue. It doesn't matter from that standpoint. Anyone who tells you that the core issue is the needs of those living here illegally has simply spent too much time in Washington.\n\nOnly the out of touch media elites think the biggest problems facing America -- you know this, this is what they talk about, facing American society today is that there are 11 million illegal immigrants who don't have legal status. And, they also think the biggest thing, and you know this, it's not nuclear, and it's not ISIS, it's not Russia, it's not China, it's global warming.\n\nTo all the politicians, donors, and special interests, hear these words from me and all of you today. There is only one core issue in the immigration debate, and that issue is the well being of the American people.\n\nNothing even comes a close second. Hillary Clinton, for instance, talks constantly about her fears that families will be separated, but she's not talking about the American families who have been permanently separated from their loved ones because of a preventable homicide, because of a preventable death, because of murder.\n\nNo, she's only talking about families who come here in violation of the law. We will treat everyone living or residing in our country with great dignity. So important.\n\nWe will be fair, just, and compassionate to all, but our greatest compassion must be for our American citizens.\n\nThank you.\n\nPresident Obama and Hillary Clinton have engaged in gross dereliction of duty by surrendering the safety of the American people to open borders, and you know it better than anybody right here in Arizona. You know it.\n\nPresident Obama and Hillary Clinton support sanctuary cities. They support catch and release on the border. they support visa overstays. They support the release of dangerous, dangerous, dangerous, criminals from detention. And, they support unconstitutional executive amnesty.\n\nHillary Clinton has pledged amnesty in her first 100 days, and her plan will provide Obamacare, Social Security, and Medicare for illegal immigrants, breaking the federal budget.\n\nOn top of that she promises uncontrolled, low-skilled immigration that continues to reduce jobs and wages for American workers, and especially for African-American and Hispanic workers within our country. Our citizens.\n\nMost incredibly, because to me this is unbelievable, we have no idea who these people are, where they come from. I always say Trojan Horse. Watch what's going to happen, folks. It's not going to be pretty.\n\nThis includes her plan to bring in 620,000 new refugees from Syria and that region over a short period of time. And even yesterday, when you were watching the news, you saw thousands and thousands of people coming in from Syria. What is wrong with our politicians, our leaders if we can call them that. What the hell are we doing?\n\nHard to believe. Hard to believe. Now that you've heard about Hillary Clinton's plan, about which she has not answered a single question, let me tell you about my plan.And do you notice --\n\nAnd do you notice all the time for weeks and weeks of debating my plan, debating, talking about it, what about this, what about that. They never even mentioned her plan on immigration because she doesn't want to get into the quagmire. It's a tough one, she doesn't know what she's doing except open borders and let everybody come in and destroy our country by the way.\n\nWhile Hillary Clinton meets only with donors and lobbyists, my plan was crafted with the input from Federal Immigration offices, very great people. Among the top immigration experts anywhere in this country, who represent workers, not corporations, very important to us.\n\nI also worked with lawmakers, who've led on this issue on behalf of American citizens for many years. And most importantly I've met with the people directly impacted by these policies. So important.\n\nNumber one, are you ready? Are you ready?\n\nWe will build a great wall along the southern border.\n\nAnd Mexico will pay for the wall.\n\nOne hundred percent. They don't know it yet, but they're going to pay for it. And they're great people and great leaders but they're going to pay for the wall. On day one, we will begin working on intangible, physical, tall, power, beautiful southern border wall.\n\nWe will use the best technology, including above and below ground sensors that's the tunnels. Remember that, above and below.\n\nAbove and below ground sensors. Towers, aerial surveillance and manpower to supplement the wall, find and dislocate tunnels and keep out criminal cartels and Mexico you know that, will work with us. I really believe it. Mexico will work with us. I absolutely believe it. And especially after meeting with their wonderful, wonderful president today. I really believe they want to solve this problem along with us, and I'm sure they will.\n\nNumber two, we are going to end catch and release. We catch them, oh go ahead. We catch them, go ahead.\n\nUnder my administration, anyone who illegally crosses the border will be detained until they are removed out of our country and back to the country from which they came.\n\nAnd they'll be brought great distances. We're not dropping them right across. They learned that. President Eisenhower. They'd drop them across, right across, and they'd come back. And across.\n\nThen when they flew them to a long distance, all of a sudden that was the end. We will take them great distances. But we will take them to the country where they came from, OK?\n\nNumber three. Number three, this is the one, I think it's so great. It's hard to believe, people don't even talk about it. Zero tolerance for criminal aliens. Zero. Zero.\n\nZero. They don't come in here. They don't come in here.\n\nAccording to federal data, there are at least 2 million, 2 million, think of it, criminal aliens now inside of our country, 2 million people criminal aliens. We will begin moving them out day one. As soon as I take office. Day one. In joint operation with local, state, and federal law enforcement.\n\nNow, just so you understand, the police, who we all respect -- say hello to the police. Boy, they don't get the credit they deserve. I can tell you. They're great people. But the police and law enforcement, they know who these people are.\n\nThey live with these people. They get mocked by these people. They can't do anything about these people, and they want to. They know who these people are. Day one, my first hour in office, those people are gone.\n\nAnd you can call it deported if you want. The press doesn't like that term. You can call it whatever the hell you want. They're gone.\n\nBeyond the 2 million, and there are vast numbers of additional criminal illegal immigrants who have fled, but their days have run out in this country. The crime will stop. They're going to be gone. It will be over.\n\nThey're going out. They're going out fast.\n\nMoving forward. We will issue detainers for illegal immigrants who are arrested for any crime whatsoever, and they will be placed into immediate removal proceedings if we even have to do that.\n\nWe will terminate the Obama administration's deadly, and it is deadly, non-enforcement policies that allow thousands of criminal aliens to freely roam our streets, walk around, do whatever they want to do, crime all over the place.\n\nThat's over. That's over, folks. That's over.\n\nSince 2013 alone, the Obama administration has allowed 300,000 criminal aliens to return back into United States communities. These are individuals encountered or identified by ICE, but who were not detained or processed for deportation because it wouldn't have been politically correct.\n\nMy plan also includes cooperating closely with local jurisdictions to remove criminal aliens immediately. We will restore the highly successful Secure Communities Program. Good program. We will expand and revitalize the popular 287(g) partnerships, which will help to identify hundreds of thousands of deportable aliens in local jails that we don't even know about.\n\nBoth of these programs have been recklessly gutted by this administration. And those were programs that worked.\n\nThis is yet one more area where we are headed in a totally opposite direction. There's no common sense, there's no brain power in our administration by our leader, or our leaders. None, none, none.\n\nHere's an interesting graphic from a study published this summer on voting attitudes among people who heard incumbents use restrictive rhetoric on immigration -- tough enforcement, no amnesty, deportations -- and its affect on their own opinions.\n\nOn my first day in office I am also going to ask Congress to pass Kate's Law, named for Kate Steinle.\n\nTo ensure that criminal aliens convicted of illegal reentry receive strong mandatory minimum sentences. Strong.\n\nAnd then we get them out.\n\nAnother reform I'm proposing is the passage of legislation named for Detective Michael Davis and Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver, to law enforcement officers recently killed by a previously deported illegal immigrant.\n\nThe Davis-Oliver bill will enhance cooperation with state and local authorities to ensure that criminal immigrants and terrorists are swiftly, really swiftly, identified and removed. And they will go face, believe me. They're going to go.\n\nWe're going to triple the number of ICE deportation officers.\n\nWithin ICE I am going to create a new special deportation task force focused on identifying and quickly removing the most dangerous criminal illegal immigrants in America who have evaded justice just like Hillary Clinton has evaded justice, OK?\n\nMaybe they'll be able to deport her.\n\nThe local police who know every one of these criminals, and they know each and every one by name, by crime, where they live, they will work so fast. And our local police will be so happy that they don't have to be abused by these thugs anymore. There's no great mystery to it, they've put up with it for years, and no finally we will turn the tables and law enforcement and our police will be allowed to clear up this dangerous and threatening mess.\n\nWe're also going to hire 5,000 more Border Patrol agents.\n\nWho gave me their endorsement, 16,500 gave me their endorsement.\n\nAnd put more of them on the border instead of behind desks which is good. We will expand the number of border patrol stations significantly.\n\nI've had a chance to spend time with these incredible law enforcement officers, and I want to take a moment to thank them. What they do is incredible.\n\nAnd getting their endorsement means so much to me. More to me really than I can say. Means so much. First time they've ever endorsed a presidential candidate.\n\nNumber four, block funding for sanctuary cities. We block the funding. No more funds.\n\nWe will end the sanctuary cities that have resulted in so many needless deaths. Cities that refuse to cooperate with federal authorities will not receive taxpayer dollars, and we will work with Congress to pass legislation to protect those jurisdictions that do assist federal authorities.\n\nNumber five, cancel unconstitutional executive orders and enforce all immigration laws.\n\nWe will immediately terminate President Obama's two illegal executive amnesties in which he defied federal law and the Constitution to give amnesty to approximately five million illegal immigrants, five million.\n\nAnd how about all the millions that are waiting on line, going through the process legally? So unfair.\n\nHillary Clinton has pledged to keep both of these illegal amnesty programs, including the 2014 amnesty which has been blocked by the United States Supreme Court. Great.\n\nClinton has also pledged to add a third executive amnesty. And by the way, folks, she will be a disaster for our country, a disaster in so many other ways.\n\nAnd don't forget the Supreme Court of the United States. Don't forget that when you go to vote on November 8. And don't forget your Second Amendment. And don't forget the repeal and replacement of Obamacare.\n\nAnd don't forget building up our depleted military. And don't forget taking care of our vets. Don't forget our vets. They have been forgotten.\n\nClinton's plan would trigger a constitutional crisis unlike almost anything we have ever seen before. In effect, she would be abolishing the lawmaking powers of Congress in order to write her own laws from the Oval Office. And you see what bad judgment she has. She has seriously bad judgment.\n\nCan you imagine? In a Trump administration all immigration laws will be enforced, will be enforced. As with any law enforcement activity, we will set priorities. But unlike this administration, no one will be immune or exempt from enforcement. And ICE and Border Patrol officers will be allowed to do their jobs the way their jobs are supposed to be done.\n\nAnyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation. That is what it means to have laws and to have a country. Otherwise we don't have a country.\n\nOur enforcement priorities will include removing criminals, gang members, security threats, visa overstays, public charges. That is those relying on public welfare or straining the safety net along with millions of recent illegal arrivals and overstays who've come here under this current corrupt administration.\n\nNumber six, we are going to suspend the issuance of visas to any place where adequate screening cannot occur.\n\nAccording to data provided by the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration, and the national interest between 9\/11 and the end of 2014, at least 380 foreign born individuals were convicted in terror cases inside the United States. And even right now the largest number of people are under investigation for exactly this that we've ever had in the history of our country.\n\nOur country is a mess. We don't even know what to look for anymore, folks. Our country has to straighten out. And we have to straighten out fast.\n\nThe number is likely higher. But the administration refuses to provide this information, even to Congress. As soon as I enter office I am going to ask the Department of State, which has been brutalized by Hillary Clinton, brutalized.\n\nHomeland Security and the Department of Justice to begin a comprehensive review of these cases in order to develop a list of regions and countries from which immigration must be suspended until proven and effective vetting mechanisms can be put in place.\n\nI call it extreme vetting right? Extreme vetting. I want extreme. It's going to be so tough, and if somebody comes in that's fine but they're going to be good. It's extreme.\n\nAnd if people don't like it, we've got have a country folks. Got to have a country. Countries in which immigration will be suspended would include places like Syria and Libya. And we are going to stop the tens of thousands of people coming in from Syria.We have no idea who they are, where they come from. There's no documentation. There's no paperwork. It's going to end badly folks. It's going to end very, very badly.\n\nFor the price of resettling, one refugee in the United States, 12 could be resettled in a safe zone in their home region. Which I agree with 100 percent. We have to build safe zones and we'll get the money from Gulf states. We don't want to put up the money. We owe almost $20 trillion. Doubled since Obama took office, our national debt.\n\nBut we will get the money from Gulf states and others. We'll supervise it. We'll build safe zones which is something that I think all of us want to see.\n\nAnother reform, involves new screening tests for all applicants that include, and this is so important, especially if you get the right people. And we will get the right people. An ideological certification to make sure that those we are admitting to our country share our values and love our people.\n\nThank you. We're very proud of our country. Aren't we? Really? With all it's going through, we're very proud of our country. For instance, in the last five years, we've admitted nearly 100,000 immigrants from Iraq and Afghanistan. And these two countries according to Pew Research, a majority of residents say that the barbaric practice of honor killings against women are often or sometimes justified. That's what they say.\n\nThat's what they say. They're justified. Right? And we're admitting them to our country. Applicants will be asked their views about honor killings, about respect for women and gays and minorities. Attitudes on radical Islam, which our President refuses to say and many other topics as part of this vetting procedure. And if we have the right people doing it, believe me, very, very few will slip through the cracks. Hopefully, none.\n\nNumber seven, we will insure that other countries take their people back when they order them deported.\n\nThere are at least 23 countries that refuse to take their people back after they've been ordered to leave the United States. Including large numbers of violent criminals, they won't take them back. So we say, OK, we'll keep them. Not going to happen with me, not going to happen with me.\n\nDue to a Supreme Court decision, if these violent offenders cannot be sent home, our law enforcement officers have to release them into your communities.\n\nAnd by the way, the results are horrific, horrific. There are often terrible consequences, such as Casey Chadwick's tragic death in Connecticut just last year. Yet despite the existence of a law that commands the Secretary of State to stop issuing visas to these countries.\n\nSecretary Hillary Clinton ignored this law and refused to use this powerful tool to bring nations into compliance. And, they would comply if we would act properly.\n\nIn other words, if we had leaders that knew what they were doing, which we don't.\n\nThe result of her misconduct was the release of thousands and thousands of dangerous criminal aliens who should have been sent home to their countries. Instead we have them all over the place. Probably a couple in this room as a matter of fact, but I hope not.\n\nAccording to a report for the Boston Globe from the year 2008 to 2014 nearly 13,000 criminal aliens were released back into U.S. communities because their home countries would not, under any circumstances, take them back. Hard to believe with the power we have. Hard to believe.\n\nWe're like the big bully that keeps getting beat up. You ever see that? The big bully that keeps getting beat up.\n\nThese 13,000 release occurred on Hillary Clinton's watch. She had the power and the duty to stop it cold, and she decided she would not do it.\n\nAnd, Arizona knows better than most exactly what I'm talking about.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThose released include individuals convicted of killings, sexual assaults, and some of the most heinous crimes imaginable.\n\nThe Boston Globe writes that a Globe review of 323 criminals released in New England from 2008 to 2012 found that as many as 30 percent committed new offenses, including rape, attempted murder, and child molestation. We take them, we take them.\n\nNumber eight, we will finally complete the biometric entry-exit visa tracking system which we need desperately. For years Congress has required biometric entry-exit visa tracking systems, but it has never been completed. The politicians are all talk, no action, never happens. Never happens.\n\nHillary Clinton, all talk. Unfortunately when there is action it's always the wrong decision. You ever notice? In my administration we will ensure that this system is in place. And, I will tell you, it will be on land, it will be on sea, it will be in air. We will have a proper tracking system.\n\nApproximately half of new illegal immigrants came on temporary visas and then never, ever left. Why should the? Nobody's telling them to leave. Stay as long as you want, we'll take care of you.\n\nBeyond violating our laws, visa overstays, pose -- and they really are a big problem, pose a substantial threat to national security. The 9\/11 Commission said that this tracking system would be a high priority and would have assisted law enforcement and intelligence officials in august and September in 2001 in conducting a search for two of the 9\/11 hijackers that were in the United States expired visas.\n\nAnd, you know what that would have meant, what that could have meant. Wouldn't that have been wonderful, right? What that could have meant?\n\nLast year alone nearly half a million individuals overstayed their temporary visas. Removing these overstays will be a top priority of my administration.\n\nIf people around the world believe they can just come on a temporary visa and never, ever leave, the Obama-Clinton policy, that's what it is, then we have a completely open border, and we no longer have a country.\n\nWe must send a message that visa expiration dates will be strongly enforced.\n\nNumber nine, we will turn off the jobs and benefits magnet.\n\nWe will ensure that E-Verify is used to the fullest extent possible under existing law, and we will work with Congress to strengthen and expand its use across the country.\n\nImmigration law doesn't exist for the purpose of keeping criminals out. It exists to protect all aspects of American life. The work site, the welfare office, the education system, and everything else.\n\nThat is why immigration limits are established in the first place. If we only enforced the laws against crime, then we have an open border to the entire world. We will enforce all of our immigration laws.\n\nAnd the same goes for government benefits. The Center for Immigration Studies estimates that 62 percent of households headed by illegal immigrants use some form of cash or non-cash welfare programs like food stamps or housing assistance.\n\nTremendous costs, by the way, to our country. Tremendous costs. This directly violates the federal public charge law designed to protect the United States Treasury. Those who abuse our welfare system will be priorities for immediate removal.\n\nNumber 10, we will reform legal immigration to serve the best interests of America and its workers, the forgotten people. Workers. We're going to take care of our workers.\n\nAnd by the way, and by the way, we're going to make great trade deals. We're going to renegotiate trade deals. We're going to bring our jobs back home. We're going to bring our jobs back home.\n\nWe have the most incompetently worked trade deals ever negotiated probably in the history of the world, and that starts with NAFTA. And now they want to go TPP, one of the great disasters.\n\nWe're going to bring our jobs back home. And if companies want to leave Arizona and if they want to leave other states, there's going to be a lot of trouble for them. It's not going to be so easy. There will be consequence. Remember that. There will be consequence. They're not going to be leaving, go to another country, make the product, sell it into the United States, and all we end up with is no taxes and total unemployment. It's not going to happen. There will be consequences.\n\nWe've admitted 59 million immigrants to the United States between 1965 and 2015. Many of these arrivals have greatly enriched our country. So true. But we now have an obligation to them and to their children to control future immigration as we are following, if you think, previous immigration waves.\n\nWe've had some big waves. And tremendously positive things have happened. Incredible things have happened. To ensure assimilation we want to ensure that it works. Assimilation, an important word. Integration and upward mobility.\n\nWithin just a few years immigration as a share of national population is set to break all historical records. The time has come for a new immigration commission to develop a new set of reforms to our legal immigration system in order to achieve the following goals.\n\nTo keep immigration levels measured by population share within historical norms. To select immigrants based on their likelihood of success in U.S. society and their ability to be financially self- sufficient.\n\nWe take anybody. Come on in, anybody. Just come on in. Not anymore.\n\nYou know, folks, it's called a two-way street. It is a two-way street, right? We need a system that serves our needs, not the needs of others. Remember, under a Trump administration it's called America first. Remember that.\n\nTo choose immigrants based on merit. Merit, skill, and proficiency. Doesn't that sound nice? And to establish new immigration controls to boost wages and to ensure that open jobs are offered to American workers first. And that in particular African- American and Latino workers who are being shut out in this process so unfairly.\n\nAnd Hillary Clinton is going to do nothing for the African- American worker, the Latino worker. She's going to do nothing. Give me your vote, she says, on November eighth. And then she'll say, so long, see you in four years. That's what it is.\n\nShe is going to do nothing. And just look at the past. She's done nothing. She's been there for 35 years. She's done nothing. And I say what do you have to lose? Choose me. Watch how good we're going to do together. Watch.\n\nYou watch. We want people to come into our country, but they have to come into our country legally and properly vetted, and in a manner that serves the national interest. We've been living under outdated immigration rules from decades ago. They're decades and decades old.\n\nTo avoid this happening in the future, I believe we should sunset our visa laws so that Congress is forced to periodically revise and revisit them to bring them up to date. They're archaic. They're ancient. We wouldn't put our entire federal budget on auto pilot for decades, so why should we do the same for the very, very complex subject of immigration?\n\nSo let's now talk about the big picture. These 10 steps, if rigorously followed and enforced, will accomplish more in a matter of months than our politicians have accomplished on this issue in the last 50 years. It's going to happen, folks. Because I am proudly not a politician, because I am not behold to any special interest, I've spent a lot of money on my campaign, I'll tell you. I write those checks. Nobody owns Trump.\n\nI will get this done for you and for your family. We'll do it right. You'll be proud of our country again. We'll do it right. We will accomplish all of the steps outlined above. And, when we do, peace and law and justice and prosperity will prevail. Crime will go down. Border crossings will plummet. Gangs will disappear.\n\nAnd the gangs are all over the place. And welfare use will decrease. We will have a peace dividend to spend on rebuilding America, beginning with our American inner cities. We're going to rebuild them, for once and for all.\n\nFor those here illegally today, who are seeking legal status, they will have one route and one route only. To return home and apply for reentry like everybody else, under the rules of the new legal immigration system that I have outlined above. Those who have left to seek entry --\n\nThank you. Thank you. Those who have left to seek entry under this new system -- and it will be an efficient system -- will not be awarded surplus visas, but will have to apply for entry under the immigration caps or limits that will be established in the future.\n\nWe will break the cycle of amnesty and illegal immigration. We will break the cycle. There will be no amnesty.\n\nOur message to the world will be this. You cannot obtain legal status or become a citizen of the United States by illegally entering our country. Can't do it.\n\nThis declaration alone will help stop the crisis of illegal crossings and illegal overstays, very importantly. People will know that you can't just smuggle in, hunker down and wait to be legalized. It's not going to work that way. Those days are over.\n\nImportantly, in several years when we have accomplished all of our enforcement and deportation goals and truly ended illegal immigration for good, including the construction of a great wall, which we will have built in record time. And at a reasonable cost, which you never hear from the government.\n\nAnd the establishment of our new lawful immigration system then and only then will we be in a position to consider the appropriate disposition of those individuals who remain.\n\nThat discussion can take place only in an atmosphere in which illegal immigration is a memory of the past, no longer with us, allowing us to weigh the different options available based on the new circumstances at the time.\n\nRight now, however, we're in the middle of a jobs crisis, a border crisis and a terrorism crisis like never before. All energies of the federal government and the legislative process must now be focused on immigration security. That is the only conversation we should be having at this time, immigration security. Cut it off.\n\nWhether it's dangerous materials being smuggled across the border, terrorists entering on visas or Americans losing their jobs to foreign workers, these are the problems we must now focus on fixing. And the media needs to begin demanding to hear Hillary Clinton's answer on how her policies will affect Americans and their security.\n\nThese are matters of life and death for our country and its people, and we deserve answers from Hillary Clinton. And do you notice, she doesn't answer.\n\nShe didn't go to Louisiana. She didn't go to Mexico. She was invited.\n\nShe doesn't have the strength or the stamina to make America great again. Believe me.\n\nWhat we do know, despite the lack of media curiosity, is that Hillary Clinton promises a radical amnesty combined with a radical reduction in immigration enforcement. Just ask the Border Patrol about Hillary Clinton. You won't like what you're hearing.\n\nThe result will be millions more illegal immigrants; thousands of more violent, horrible crimes; and total chaos and lawlessness. That's what's going to happen, as sure as you're standing there.\n\nThis election, and I believe this, is our last chance to secure the border, stop illegal immigration and reform our laws to make your life better. I really believe this is it. This is our last time. November 8. November 8. You got to get out and vote on November 8.\n\nIt's our last chance. It's our last chance. And that includes Supreme Court justices and Second Amendment. Remember that.\n\nSo I want to remind everyone what we're fighting for and who we are fighting for.\n\nI am going to ask -- these are really special people that I've gotten to know. I'm going to ask all the Angel Moms to come join me on the stage right now. These are amazing women.\n\nThese are amazing people.\n\n(Family members speak individually.)\n\nThank you.\n\nThese are amazing people, and I am not asking for their endorsement, believe me that. I just think I've gotten to know so many of them, and many more, from our group. But they are incredible people and what they're going through is incredible, and there's just no reason for it. Let's give them a really tremendous hand.\n\nThat's tough stuff, I will tell you. That is tough stuff. Incredible people.\n\nSo, now is the time for these voices to be heard. Now is the time for the media to begin asking questions on their behalf. Now is the time for all of us as one country, Democrat, Republican, liberal, conservative to band together to deliver justice, and safety, and security for all Americans.\n\nLet's fix this horrible, horrible, problem. It can be fixed quickly. Let's our secure our border.\n\nLet's stop the drugs and the crime from pouring into our country. Let's protect our social security and Medicare. Let's get unemployed Americans off the welfare and back to work in their own country.\n\nThis has been an incredible evening. We're going to remember this evening. November 8, we have to get everybody. This is such an important state. November 8 we have to get everybody to go out and vote.\n\nWe're going to bring -- thank you, thank you. We're going to take our country back, folks. This is a movement. We're going to take our country back.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nThis is an incredible movement. The world is talking about it. The world is talking about it and by the way, if you haven't been looking to what's been happening at the polls over the last three or four days I think you should start looking. You should start looking.\n\nTogether we can save American lives, American jobs, and American futures. Together we can save America itself. Join me in this mission, we're going to make America great again.\n\nThank you. I love you. God bless you, everybody. God bless you. God bless you, thank you.\u0000","67":"Today, I am here to talk about three crucial words that should be at the center of our foreign policy: Peace Through Strength.\nWe want to achieve a stable, peaceful world with less conflict and more common ground.\n\nI am proposing a new foreign policy focused on advancing America's core national interests, promoting regional stability, and producing an easing of tensions in the world. This will require rethinking the failed policies of the past.\n\nWe can make new friends, rebuild old alliances, and bring new allies into the fold.\n\nI'm proud to have the support of warfighting generals, active duty military, and the top experts who know both how to win - and how to avoid the endless wars we are caught in now. Just yesterday, 88 top Generals and Admirals endorsed my campaign.\n\nIn a Trump Administration, our actions in the Middle East will be tempered by realism. The current strategy of toppling regimes, with no plan for what to do the day after, only produces power vacuums that are filled by terrorists.\n\nGradual reform, not sudden and radical change, should be our guiding objective in that region.\n\nWe should work with any country that shares our goal of destroying ISIS and defeating Radical Islamic terrorism, and form new friendships and partnerships based on this mission. We now have an Administration, and a former Secretary of State, who refuse to say Radical Islamic Terrorism.\n\nImmediately after taking office, I will ask my generals to present to me a plan within 30 days to defeat and destroy ISIS.\n\nThis will require military warfare, but also cyber warfare, financial warfare, and ideological warfare - as I laid out in my speech on defeating Radical Islamic terrorism several weeks ago.\n\nInstead of an apology tour, I will proudly promote our system of government and our way of life as the best in the world - just like we did in our campaign against communism during the Cold War.\n\nWe will show the whole world how proud we are to be American.\n\nAt the same time, immigration security is a vital part of our national security.\n\nWe only want to admit people to our country who will support our values and love our people.\n\nThese are the pillars of a sound national security strategy.\n\nUnlike my opponent, my foreign policy will emphasize diplomacy, not destruction. Hillary Clinton's legacy in Iraq, Libya, and Syria has produced only turmoil and suffering. Her destructive policies have displaced millions of people, then she has invited the refugees into the West with no plan to screen them.\n\nIncluding Veteran healthcare costs, the price of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan could total $6 trillion, according to a report in the Washington Examiner. Yet, after all this money spent and lives lost, Clinton's policies as Secretary of State have left the Middle East in more disarray than ever before.\n\nMeanwhile, China has grown more aggressive, and North Korea more dangerous and belligerent. Russia has defied this Administration at every turn. Putin has no respect for President Obama or Hillary Clinton.\n\nSometimes it has seemed like there wasn't a country in the Middle East that Hillary Clinton didn't want to invade, intervene or topple. She is trigger-happy and unstable when it comes to war.\n\nHillary Clinton is just reckless - so reckless, in fact, she put her emails on an illegal server that our enemies could easily hack. Then Clinton's team used a technology called bleachbit to acid wash her emails. They even took a hammer to some of her 13 phones, to cover her tracks and obstruct justice. These email records were destroyed after she received a subpoena to turn them over.\n\nIn the FBI report, she claimed she couldn't recall important information on 39 occasions.\n\nShe can't even remember whether she was trained in classified information, and said she didn't even know the letter \"C\" means confidential.\n\nIf she can't remember such crucial events and information, she is unfit to be Commander-in-Chief.\n\nHer conduct is simply disqualifying.\n\nShe talks about her experience, but Hillary Clinton's only foreign policy experience is \"failure.\" Everywhere she got involved, things got worse.\n\nLet's look back at the Middle East at the very beginning of 2009, before Hillary Clinton was sworn-in.\n\nLibya was stable.\n\nSyria was under control.\n\nEgypt was ruled by a secular President and an ally of the United States.\n\nIraq was experiencing a reduction in violence. The group that would become what we now call ISIS was close to being extinguished.\n\nIran was being choked off by economic sanctions.\n\nFast-forward to today. What have the decisions of Obama-Clinton produced?\n\nLibya is in ruins, our ambassador and three other brave Americans are dead, and ISIS has gained a new base of operations.\n\nSyria is in the midst of a disastrous civil war. ISIS controls large portions of territory. A refugee crisis now threatens Europe and the United States. And hundreds of thousands are dead.\n\nIn Egypt, terrorists have gained a foothold in the Sinai desert, near the Suez Canal, one of the most essential waterways in the world.\n\nIraq is in chaos, and ISIS is on the loose.\n\nISIS has spread across the Middle East, and into the West.\n\nIran, the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism, is now flush with $150 billion dollars in cash released by the United States - plus another $1.7 billion dollars in cash ransom payments. In other words, our country was blackmailed and extorted into paying this unheard-of amount of money.\n\nWorst of all, the Nuclear deal puts Iran, the number one state sponsor of Radical Islamic terrorism, on a path to nuclear weapons.\n\nThis is Hillary Clinton's foreign policy legacy.\n\nBut that's not all. President Obama and Hillary Clinton have also overseen deep cuts in our military, which only invite more aggression from our adversaries.\n\nHistory shows that when America is not prepared is when the danger is greatest. We want to deter, avoid and prevent conflict through our unquestioned military strength.\n\nUnder Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, defense spending is on track to fall to its lowest level as a share of the economy since the end of World War II. We currently have the smallest Army since 1940. The Navy is among the smallest it has been since 1915. And the Air Force is the smallest it has been since 1947.\n\nWhen Ronald Reagan left office, our Navy had 592 ships. When Barack Obama took office, it had 285 ships. Today, the Navy has just 276 ships.\n\nThe average Air Force aircraft is 27 years-old. We have 2nd generation B-52 bombers - their fathers flew the same plane.\n\nOur Army has been shrinking rapidly, from 553,000 soldiers in 2009 to just 479,000 today.\n\nIn 2009, our Marine Corps had 202,000 active Marines. Today, it's just 182,000.\n\nOur ship count is below the minimum of 308 that the Navy says is needed to execute its current missions. President Obama plans to reduce the Army to 450,000 troops--which would hamstring our ability to defend the United States.\n\nIt takes 22 years on average to field a major new weapons system.\n\nIn 2010, the US spent $554 billion on non-war base defense spending.\n\nIn the current year, we are spending $548 billion - a cut of 10% in real inflation-adjusted dollars. This reduction was done through what is known as the sequester, or automatic defense budget cuts. Under the budget agreement, defense took half of the cuts - even though it makes up only one-sixth of the budget.\n\nAs soon as I take office, I will ask Congress to fully eliminate the defense sequester and will submit a new budget to rebuild our military.\n\nThis will increase certainty in the defense community as to funding, and will allow military leaders to plan for our future defense needs.\n\nAs part of removing the defense sequester, I will ask Congress to fully offset the costs of increased military spending. In the process, we will make government leaner and more responsive to the public.\n\nI will ask that savings be accomplished through common sense reforms that eliminate government waste and budget gimmicks - and that protect hard-earned benefits for Americans.\n\nGovernment-wide, improper government payments are estimated to exceed $135 billion per year, and the amount of unpaid taxes is estimated to be as high as $385 billion.\n\nWe can also reduce the size of the federal bureaucracy through responsible workforce attrition - that is, when employees retire, they can be replaced by a smaller number of new employees.\n\nWe can also stop funding programs that are not authorized in law. Congress spent $320 billion last year on 256 expired laws. Removing just 5 percent of that will reduce spending by almost $200 billion over 10 years.\n\nThe military will not be exempt either - the military bureaucracy will have to be trimmed as well.\n\nEarly in my term, I will also be requesting that all NATO nations promptly pay their bills, which many are not doing right now. Only 5 NATO countries, including the United States, are currently meeting the minimum requirement to spend 2% of GDP on defense.\n\nAdditionally, I will be respectfully asking countries such as Germany, Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia to pay more for the tremendous security we provide them.\n\nFinally, we will have at our disposal additional revenues from unleashing American energy. The Institute for Energy Research cites a \"short-run\" figure of as much as $36 billion annually from increased energy production.\n\nUsing these new funds, I will ask my Secretary of Defense to propose a new defense budget to meet the following long-term goals:\n\nWe will build an active Army of around 540,000, as the Army's chief of staff has said he needs. We now have only 31 Brigade Combat Teams, or 490,000 troops, and only one-third of combat teams are considered combat-ready.\n\nWe will build a Marine Corps based on 36 battalions, which the Heritage Foundation notes is the minimum needed to deal with major contingencies - we have 23 now.\n\nWe will build a Navy of 350 surface ships and submarines, as recommended by the bipartisan National Defense Panel - we have 276 ships now.\n\nAnd we will build an Air Force of at least 1,200 fighter aircraft, which the Heritage Foundation has shown to be needed to execute current missions - we have 1,113 now.\n\nWe will also seek to develop a state of the art missile defense system.\n\nUnder Obama-Clinton, our ballistic missile defense capability has been degraded at the very moment the US and its allies are facing a heightened missile threat from states like Iran and North Korea. As these potential adversaries grow their missile programs, US military facilities in Asia and the Middle East, as well as our allies, are increasingly in range, with the United States homeland also potentially threatened.\n\nWe propose to rebuild the key tools of missile defense, starting with the Navy cruisers that are the foundation of our missile defense capabilities in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. The Obama-Clinton administration tried repeatedly to remove our cruisers from service, then refused to modernize these aging ships.\n\nWe will start by modernizing our cruisers to provide the Ballistic Missile Defense capability our nation needs; this will cost around $220 million per modernization as we seek to modernize a significant portion of these 22 ships.\n\nAs we expand our Navy toward the goal of 350 ships, we will also procure additional modern destroyers that are designed to handle the missile defense mission in the coming years.\n\nAccomplishing this military rebuild will be a fifty-state effort --every state in the union will be able to take part in rebuilding our military and developing the technologies of tomorrow.\n\nIn addition, we will improve the Department of Defense's cyber capabilities. Hillary Clinton has taught us all how vulnerable we are to cyber hacking.\n\nWhich is why one of the first things we must do is to enforce all classification rules, and enforce all laws relating to the handling of classified information.\n\nHillary Clinton put her emails on a secret server to cover-up her pay-for-play scandals at the State Department. Nothing threatens the integrity of our Democracy more than when government officials put their public office up for sale.\n\nWe will also make it a priority to develop defensive and offensive cyber capabilities at our U.S. Cyber Command, and recruit the best and brightest Americans.\n\nOne of my first directives after taking office will be asking the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and all relevant federal departments, to conduct a thorough review of United States cyber defenses and identify all vulnerabilities - in our power grid, our communications systems, and all vital infrastructure. I will then ask for a plan to immediately protect those vulnerabilities. At the same time, we will invest heavily in offensive cyber capabilities to disrupt our enemies, including terrorists who rely heavily on internet communications.\n\nThese new investments in cybersecurity, and the modernization of our military, will spur substantial new job creation in the private sector and help create the jobs and technologies of tomorrow.\n\nAmerica must be the world's dominant technological powerhouse of the 21st century, and young Americans - including in our inner cities - should get these new jobs.\n\nWe must also ensure that we have the best medical care, education and support for our military service members and their families - both when they serve, and when they return to civilian life.\n\nOur debt to our men and women in uniform is eternal.\n\nTo all those who have served this nation, I say: I will never let you down.\n\nWe will protect those who protect us.\n\nAnd we will follow their example of unity. We will work across all racial and income lines to create One American Nation.\n\nTogether, we will have one great American future.\n\nWe will be one people, under one God, saluting one American flag.\n\nAmerica will be a prosperous, generous and inclusive society.\n\nWe will discard the failed policies and division of the past, and embrace true American change to rebuild our economy, rebuild our inner cities, and rebuild our country.\n\nWe will bring back our jobs.\n\nWe will make America strong again.\n\nWe will make America safe again.\n\nAnd we will make America great again.\u0000","68":"This is amazing. What a great place. Thank you very much. We have thousands of people outside trying to get in. But we should start. Do we agree? \nWe should start. So they'll come in. They'll come in.\n\nFirst of all I want to thank you. Special, special place. It's a special place with incredible people. In one day, do you believe this? One day we are going to win the great state of North Carolina...\n\nAnd we are going to win back the White House. \n\nThis election will decide whether we are ruled by a corrupt political class. You're seeing what's happening. Everybody's watching. Or whether we are ruled by the people. We're going to be ruled by the people, folks. \n\nThat is going to be the choice. A failed political establishment has delivered nothing but poverty, nothing but problems, nothing but losses. Nothing but losses. We don't win anymore as a country. We're going to start winning again. \n\nThey get rich by making America poorer in many cases. It's time to reject the media and political elite that has bled our country dry. \n\nAnd these are among the most dishonest people. They don't give you the truth, folks. They don't give you the truth. \n\nThey rarely give you the truth. You know it. And they know it. That's the scary part. They know it.\n\nIt's time to fight for America. I'm not a politician, I can say proudly. My only special interest is you. It's you. \n\nWe're going to bring back the jobs that have been stolen from you. We're going to bring back the wealth that has been taken from our country. We're going to bring back the miners and the factory workers and the steel workers. We're going to put them back to work. \n\nThe economic policies of Bill and Hillary Clinton have destroyed manufacturing in your state and throughout the entire country.\n\nThe corrupt Clintons gave us NAFTA. China's too horrible entry into the World Trade Organization. One of the disasters. The job-killing deal with South Korea. That was a Hillary Clinton beauty. And the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will be a total disaster. \n\nThat Hillary Clinton said this is the gold standard. And you know what? It is the gold -- she lied. She lied during the debate. She said -- hey, by the way, who won the debate? Did we win that debate? \n\nBut she lied during the debate. She lied during the debate. She said it's the gold standard. And then she said she never said it.\n\nDon't worry about coal. We're bringing back coal, sir. He's holding up a couple of...\n\nClean coal. Clean coal. Right? We're going to do clean coal, the miners. The miners are going to be back. Not if Hillary Clinton gets in. The miners, I guess you got to start thinking about something else. But the miners are going to be back. Clean coal. Clean coal\n\nYou know, thinking about it, though. Also, people, the press doesn't talk about it. Donna Brazile gets the questions through a debate...but then it turns out to be a number of debates. \n\nWho cares about Donna Brazile? She's turned out to be not what people thought. She gets, illegally -- illegally. She gets the questions to the debate. She then takes those questions and gives them to crooked Hillary Clinton. \n\nNow, does crooked Hillary report it? Does she say I shouldn't have these questions or these answers? I think they gave them the answers also, right? No, she doesn't. They doesn't.\n\nI wonder if she had -- I wonder if she had the questions in my debates. I don't think so because she didn't do that well. I don't think so. I don't think so. But the years of betrayal will end. And they will end. And they're going to end quickly. They're going to end as of the day we take office, which is going to be very, very soon. \n\nThe theft of North Carolina jobs will end. You've taken in harder than most states.\n\nReal change begins with immediately repealing and replacing Obamacare. \n\nSadly, it's just been announced that the residents of North Carolina are going to experience massive double-digit premium hikes. Ninety-five...of the 100 North Carolina counties will only have one insurer in the Obamacare exchange next year. Lots of luck negotiating.\n\nHonestly, it's not going to matter because we're going to win and we're going to terminate it. You're going to have such great health care...for much less money. It won't matter. \n\nPremiums are searching. Companies are leaving. Insurers are fleeing. Doctors are quitting.\n\nBy the way, doctors, they're leaving. They're quitting. I have a friend who's a doctor. He said that I have more accountants than I have nurses, it's so complicated.\n\nAnd deductibles are going through the roof. Yet Hillary Clinton wants to double down and expand Obamacare and make it even more expensive. \n\nI'm asking for your vote so we can repeal and replace Obamacare, and save health care for every family in North Carolina. \n\nThank you. Thank you.\n\nThank you. \n\nPeople are pouring in, folks. They're pouring in.\n\nDid you see last night in Michigan the crowd we had? And the crowd we had -- by the way, how about 24,000 maybe 25,000 right next to Fort Brag. You saw that the other night. \n\nAnd we went to Minnesota. Minnesota's been treated very, very badly. We went to Minnesota where we're doing very well. Everyone said why Minnesota? That doesn't go Republican. It's going Republican this year, I'll tell you. Minnesota. Great place.\n\nAnd you know, you've been watching and you've been seeing and these people are being driven crazy, the dishonest media. We're winning Ohio. We're winning Iowa. We're winning, we think, New Hampshire. We're going to do great in New Hampshire. I hear we're winning North Carolina big... \n\nI hear.\n\nWe're winning Florida. We're winning Florida, doing really well. Headlines today are on drudge. how well we're doing in Florida. And I think we're going to win the great state of Pennsylvania, I do.\n\nThen we're winning plenty of other places. So we have to go. The big key, you have to go. You don't win a rigged system, folks. We're in a rigged system. You got to go. You got to vote. Got to make sure that vote gets registered.\n\nReal change also means restoring honesty to our government\n\nThank you. Thank you. Wow. Great, great spirit.\n\nI have a job right next to -- we have a beautiful, beautiful property right next to -- right near Charlotte. You know about it, folks? It's great right? Some of the people. But it's an amazing place. It's an amazing place to work and to live, and we love it.\n\nHillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the presidency of the United States. \n\nShe threatened national security, she sold her office to the highest bidder. And then to cover her tracks...she deleted 33,000 emails after receiving a congressional subpoena, nothing happens to her. Nothing happens \n\nShe's being protected by a totally rigged system -- General James Cartwright. A four-star general. Two weeks ago probably going to jail for up to five years for doing nothing by comparison. But he said he did it for national security reasons and I can understand that. Go to jail for up to five years. General betrayes, his life was destroyed and here she is she is running for president 25 times worse than anybody has ever dreamt. It's a rigged system. It is a rigged rigged system. \n\nDon't worry, folks. The cameras will never spin around and show this crowd. They never do. They show my face and the two people behind me, not the thousands behind me. They never do. They never do.  \n\nSo dishonest. There they are. There they are. My group. Women for Trump. \n\nWomen for Trump. \n\nThey've been following me, these ladies, for a long time. How are we doing? Are we doing well?\n\nGreat people. Women for Trump.\n\nAnd now it's up to the American people to deliver the justice that we deserve at the ballot box tomorrow. At the ballot box. We're going to win.\n\nI think it's a great way of showing what we have to show in light of what's going on with justice in this country. I really do. I think it's a great way. You show it tomorrow. We show it tomorrow.\n\nMy contract with the American voter begins with a plan to end government corruption and to take our country back from the special interests. \n\nAnd folks, I was on the other side for a long time. It's a very good place to be. But I love the country. I love this country. I've really gotten to love the people of this country because I have been everywhere. We have the greatest people on earth. But I love this country.\n\nAnd I couldn't watch it when they made the Iran deal. They gave them $150 billion, a terrorist state. \n\nA state that was ready to collapse until we made them rich and powerful. We gave them a path to nuclear weapons. They were ready to collapse. We gave them, remember, $400 billion, right? We gave them $400 million. Then we found out that was -- it wasn't $400 million. It was $1.7 billion in cash. In cash. Do you know what $1.7 billion in cash is? You could take that whole side of the arena and you wouldn't have enough room. How stupid are we to allow this to happen? Our leaders are incompetent. President Obama is campaigning today with Hillary Clinton because she can't campaign. \n\nShe can't campaign. \n\nSo Obama is taking Air Force One, which costs a fortune. You know he's very much into the environment. And he'll take a massive, old engine 747. Very much into the environment. Very much into the ozone layer. And yet he'll fly that 747 all over the place to campaign for crooked Hillary.\n\nAnd I don't think it's going to work. And she's not getting any crowds. So she gets Beyonce and Jay-Z. I like them. \n\nI like them. \n\nAnd you know what they do? I get bigger crowds than they do. \n\nIt's true. I get far bigger crowds. \n\nLook at this place. I mean, look at the crowds we had in Michigan.\n\nBy the way, Michigan is in play. It hasn't been in play for Republicans for 30 something years. Michigan is in play because they're tired of watching their car factories be taken out. They're tired of losing their jobs to Mexico.\n\nFord. Ford right now moved all of its small car production to Mexico. They're building the biggest plants in the world in Mexico. And Michigan has been complaining about it for five years to Mexico. \n\nNo, we're going to have some -- tomorrow's going to be a very historic day. I really believe that. I think it's going to show -- I think it's going to be a Brexit plus, plus, plus. Does that make sense? \n\nPlus, plus, plus. \n\nIt will be amazing. It will be amazing.\n\nI want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear the words we're all about to say. This is a phrase, I told you. I didn't like it. I thought it was hokie. But it's not hokie. It's called \"drain the swamp.\"\n\nWe're going to go to Washington. We're going to drain the swamp. Can't believe it.\n\nI told the story. I hated that expression. I said no way I'm going to say that, no way. That's so hokie. And I said it. The place went crazy.\n\nThen I said it to another place. It went crazier. Then I said it with more confidence because you know confidence is -- and it went wild. Now I love the expression. I think it was genius.\n\nDrain the swamp. Drain the swamp. \n\nIs there any place better to be than a Trump rally? Are we having fun? \n\nAre we having fun? No? And I don't have a guitar. And I don't have a piano. All we have is great concepts for our country, which is the most important thing. Because frankly, when people get on stage, and they're entertainers, and they entertain in order to get people to fill up a room for Hillary Clinton.\n\nAnd by the way, they use the dirtiest language the other night. And it was -- many of the people left. You know they're political people. They heard words they've never heard before. They left.\n\nSo the place was half empty by the time -- actually, it never got full, even with them. Then it was pretty much empty midway through. And then most of the people just left. And when Hillary got up there was practically -- she might as well just have started with a few people. It would've been easier. \n\nBut you know she hears those words. I won't use the words. I won't even address the words. Because if I do the crooked media will say \"did you hear what Donald Trump said today?\" \n\nBut honestly -- yes. \n\nThose words were disgusting. If I ever said those words that Jay-Z said or that Beyonce said the other night, you know what would happen to me? The reinstitution of the electric chair.\n\nIt would be -- how about if I got the answers to the debate? Or if I got the questions? Supposing instead of Hillary getting the questions to the debate, which is cheating. She's a cheat. She is a cheat. She never reported it. She is a cheat.\n\nSo supposing instead of her -- supposing somebody gave Donald Trump the questions to the debate. Headlines all over the world. He must withdraw from the race. You don't even hear anything about crooked Hillary. She got the questions.\n\nTo me that's such a big difference. Some people say, my people, oh don't mention that, it's just -- I say to me it's a big deal.\n\nIt's a big deal. But it's not a big deal for the dishonest media to say. They don't want to report it. But just think about it, supposing it was us.\n\nAt the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs. Bring them back to America. \n\nAnd by the way, you have a great governor. Support your governor. He's a great guy.  Where is he? He's here someplace. He's a great guy and he's in a tough fight. And he's going to win that fight. But he's a great guy. So hopefully you'll support your governor.\n\nNorth Carolina has lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and his lovely wife, Hillary. \n\nWell think of it. Think of it. Think of the numbers of jobs.\n\nHere's the one that gets me the most. Two things get me the most. Two things that just don't seem real. Because we're going to take care of our veterans, right? Like big league. Because our veterans are great.\n\nBut two statistics I can't believe. Twenty-two suicides a day for our veterans.\n\nThink of it. You wouldn't think that's possible. Because they're treated so badly. They wait on line for six, seven, eight days for simple procedure that could solve their problem or for a prescription.\n\nBut two numbers I don't -- it just doesn't make sense. Twenty-two suicides a day for our veterans. OK? It doesn't make sense.\n\nAnd here's another one. America has lost 70,000 factories. Now I thought they meant 700 or 7,000 maybe. It's 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization, another Bill and Hillary Clinton-backed disaster.\n\nThink of it though. \n\nThink of what 70,000 factories is.\n\nSo those are the two numbers. They just don't seem to be real. Sad numbers. Sad numbers. Especially the vets, to be honest with you.\n\nWe're living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of our world. There's never been anything happened to a country like has been happening to the United States. Our jobs are fleeing. Our companies are being taken. And leaving. And leaving.\n\nA Trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving America. And we will stop the jobs from leaving North Carolina. Believe me. \n\nIf a company wants to fire their workers and leave, as an example North Carolina, and move to another country, and then ship their products back into the United States through what will be a very strong border, by the way.\n\nWe will make them pay a 35 percent tax on every product that they ship back here. \n\nAnd here's what's going to happen. They're not going to leave. They're not going to leave.\n\nNow your politicians, some of them don't understand it. Some only cut taxes for the middle class. And by the way, Hillary Clinton wants to raise your taxes, and you know that \n\nSubstantially.\n\nSo one of the highest taxes in the world, she wants to raise your taxes. Same old story.\n\nWe will unleash the power of American energy including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal. Our plan will end the EPA intrusion into your family farms, and stop double taxation of a family farm at that. \n\nWe will cancel billions in global warming payments to the United Nations. Billions and billions of dollars. And we have no idea what they do with that money. I actually have a pretty good idea. You're not going to like it. And use that -- we're going to use that money to rebuild the infrastructure of our country. \n\nAnd we will rebuild our inner cities. The African-American community, the Hispanic community...have had such lies told to them. They live -- many, many people living in the inner cities of our country, they're getting worse and worse. The crime is unbelievable. You can't walk to the store and get a loaf of bread. Often you get shot.\n\nChicago. Thousands and thousands of shootings since Jan. 1. You read it. The murder rate of the United States is the highest it's been in 45 years. The dishonest media doesn't tell you that stuff because they want you to like Obama. They want you to think Obama is doing a good job. And he's not.  And he's not. \n\nAnd he's not. \n\nSo you live in the inner cities. You're African-American. You're Hispanic. The schools are no good. There are no jobs. And it's totally unsafe. And I say I will fix it. What the hell do you have to lose? I'm going to fix it. \n\nWe are all going to fix it. \n\nWe're going to fix it. We're going to bring back jobs. We're going to bring back safety. And we're going to get really good education going. There is tremendous potential, folks, in the inner cities, believe me, tremendous potential.\n\nWe will become a rich nation again. But to be a rich nation, we must also be a safe nation. Hillary Clinton wants a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees flowing into our country. \n\nUnbelievable. It's unbelievable. \n\nHer plan will import generations of terrorism, extremism and radicalism into your schools and throughout your communities. And you don't even know where they're going. Your government doesn't even know where they're going.\n\nWhen I'm elected president, we will suspend the Syrian refugee program...and we will keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. \n\nHave no choice. \n\nWe have no choice.\n\n USA. USA. USA.\n\n We have no choice.\n\nBut we're going to work because we all have hearts and it's a big problem, caused to a large extent by Obama and Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe migration, caused to a large extent -- ISIS was caused by them. They left a big vacuum. There was no ISIS when she first served as secretary. There was no ISIS. She created it.\n\nNow she stands at the debate, \"I will fight ISIS.\" She's got no chance. She's going to fight nobody. She wants to go home and go to sleep. \n\nUnbelievable. She's going to fight ISIS.\n\nSo we're going to build -- we're going to build, we are going to build safe havens. We're going to have the Gulf States who have nothing but money, they're going to pay for it. We have $20 trillion in debt. And if it's OK, I'm not going to spend a penny. We have $20 trillion in debt. And we still have to rebuild our country.\n\nYou know it's one thing like when you buy a company and it's got some debt. We have $20 trillion in debt. But the country's a mess. The roads are bad. The bridges are bad. The schools are bad. The hospitals are bad. The tunnels are bad. Everything's bad. The military needs massive amounts of money.\n\nSo we have all this horrible debt. It's one thing if we had it and everything's in tippy top shape. I like to say. You know I like the properties. Give me them. I want them. Give me them. But we have them and they're a mess. And we have $20 trillion, which is far too much.\n\nSo we're going to get it down. And we're going to rebuild our country. We have so many things we're going to be doing. We're going to be a rich nation again. \n\nA Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. \n\nAnd yes, we will build a great wall and Mexico will pay for the wall 100 percent. \n\nOne hundred percent. \n\nMexico will pay. If you look at the incredible -- if you look at the incredible deficits we have with Mexico, it's unbelievable. What we have, the cost of that wall is peanuts, is peanuts compared to the numbers you're talking about on trade with Mexico.\n\nAnd the numbers with China? Trade deficit? I mean we will have a trade deficit with China of close to $500 billion this year. We are going to lose in worldwide trade of goods, we're going to lose worldwide close to $800 billion. What are we doing?\n\nYou really ask, who is negotiating these deals? Where do these people come? You know where they come from? They're political hacks.\n\nYou're dealing with the smartest people in the world. You have Chinese people, every -- you have from Japan, you have from all these other countries. They put their smartest and the best. We put political hacks that don't know what they're doing.\n\nSo we have an -- and we have the greatest in the world. We have the greatest business people. We have the greatest negotiators. We don't use them. We don't use them. We use political people. Some of them got their job because they give campaign contributions. \n\nWe're going to get it straightened out, folks, starting tomorrow. Go vote. Go vote. \n\nRight?\n\nMy women. Hillary supports totally open borders. There goes your country. And strongly supports sanctuary cities like San Francisco where Kate Steinle was murdered violently by an illegal immigrant deported at least five times. We will cancel all federal funding to sanctuary cities. \n\nWe will stop illegal immigration, deport all criminal aliens and dismantle every last criminal gang and cartel threatening our citizens. \n\nWe will also repeal the Obama-Clinton Defense sequester, and rebuild our badly depleted military. \n\nThere have been few times in our history where we've needed it more, few times. North Carolina will be at the very center of this effort with brand new advanced fighters flying from Seymour Johnson Air Force Base. \n\nBeautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful, beautiful new fighters from Seymour Johnson.\n\nAnd we're going to have more battalions. You know the Marines are way, way off in terms of numbers. You know that. I know. Has there ever been? Yes, there have been. But rarely do we have times when we need this strong presence like now. The world hates us. The world hates us.\n\nSo we're going to increase -- thank you. We're going to increase Marine battalions at Camp Lejeune. I've been to Camp Lejeune...\n\nThey make major new investments. Where I was the other night, right next to it. I guess like 25,000 or 27,000 people at Fort Bragg. \n\nGreat people. All soldiers are tough. A couple of them shook my hand. It was like oy, whoa. Take it easy, fellas. They are tough cookies. They are strong. They don't know how strong they are. These are great people.\n\nAnd new military technologies will be researched and developed right here at the Research Triangle. Right here. \n\nI'm honored to have the endorsements of more than 200 top admirals and generals, and 22 Medal of Honor recipients. And every day those numbers go up big league. Big league. Show Less Text\n\nAnd I asked some of the generals and admirals the other night by Fort Bragg. I asked them. I said fellas, let me ask you a question. They want to take over Mosul. Am I getting something wrong? Whatever happened to the element of surprise for us?\n\nI'm talking to admirals now and generals. That's what they do. I do other things. But you know it's called like common sense.\n\nYou got to say we've made a lot of right calls. I said why is it that four months away from going into Mosul they're announcing \"we are going into Mosul?\" We're going into Mosul because we want to get the leaders of ISIS and they're staying in Mosul. And then three months they're saying \"we are going in, in three months to Mosul.\" And then we're going in, in two months.\n\nAnd every time I hear, I put my hands, I go like this. I don't want to hear this, please. And as you know, they've been met with tremendous resistance, much more than they would've been\n\nAnd I guarantee you this. I can't say it with certainty, only about 99.9 percent, OK? I can't say -- nothing's 100 percent. Even our victory isn't 100 percent. But it's starting to look pretty close, isn't it? \n\nThose numbers. Those numbers. \n\nOh, these guys are unhappy. Look at them. They're not happy. They are unhappy campers. Starting to look good. \n\nStarting to look good.\n\nBut wouldn't it be nice if instead of announcing four months ago and there months ago. Then they have last -- two weeks ago they go next week we're getting ready to raid.\n\nThe leaders all left. They're gone. And the other people are putting up much more of a fight. Horrible. They're using human shields. It's a horrible situation. I mean it's hell. It's hell.\n\nBut why do we just watch what's going on. Hillary and her failed establishment have trillion dollars on wars in the Middle East that we never win. We just keep fighting and fighting. It's like a hose. The money just keeps pouring out. We never win.\n\nAnd now the Middle East is in worse shape by far than it's ever been. We have the Great Migration, the whole thing. They've dragged -- thank you. \n\nI don't even want to look. I'll get myself. I don't want to look. \n\nThey'll make it -- I won't even say I love you too because they're going to make it a major headline if I said that. World's most dishonest people. The world's really dishonest people. \n\nThey dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe. Shipped our jobs and wealth all over -- right open at home. You ever notice we send these incredible troops, so much death, so much injury, in order to create a border for a country that most people have never even heard of. And yet we don't protect our own borders. Isn't it an incredible thing?\n\nThat will change starting tomorrow. \n\nBecause from now on it's going to be America first, America first. \n\nSo just in summing up, to all Americans I say it's time for a real leadership and time for change. We have to have change. \n\nCan you imagine having Hillary for four years? \n\nI'm being serious about that. I wouldn't want to watch the news every night.\n\nI mean look at what she's done with the e-mails as an example. I mean did you ever see a mess like this? Did you ever see -- of course the FBI -- the director was obviously under tremendous pressure. So they went through 650,000 e-mails in eight days. Right.\n\nSo sad what's going on. And she still deleted them after getting a subpoena from Congress. I mean that's a crime. What happened? That's a crime. You don't even need the new stuff. She shouldn't be allowed to run. Shouldn't be allowed to run.\n\nJust think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days of a Trump administration. \n\nWe're going to have the biggest tax cuts since Ronald Reagan.\n\nAnd Hillary is going to raise your taxes substantially.\n\nWe're going to save and protect your Social Security and Medicare. \n\nAnd Hillary is going to cut your Social Security and really injure Medicare. That's what's going to happen.\n\nWe will eliminate every unnecessary, job-killing regulation. We'll cancel every illegal Obama executive order. \n\nBy the way, a man that loves this state. It's his birthday today. Billy Graham, 98. \n\nThe father of Franklin. Billy Graham. What a great one, right? Ninety-eight years old. He is a fantastic man. Franklin's a fantastic man. And it's so wonderful to have support of people like that.\n\nWe're going to protect religious liberty...rebuild our military and take care of our great veterans. We're going to take care of our veterans. \n\nWe will provide school choice and put an end to Common Core. We move our education locally. \n\nWe will support the men and women -- these are great people, the men and women of law enforcement. \n\nWe're going to save our Second Amendment. \n\nAnd appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. \n\nThis sounds so good to me because I started this on June 16th of last year because I couldn't stand when I looked at what was going on with our country, I couldn't stand it. I couldn't stand it.\n\nComing down the escalator, right, with Melania. Coming down that escalator June 16 of last year. And they were all saying -- there were all the dishonest pundits. Actually a few of them thought I had a hell of a chance if you want to know the -- the smarter ones. But they were all saying but he's not involved with -- I've been involved with politics all my life, on the other side. But I've been involved.\n\nWe had 17 people -- by the way, one of the great people in here tonight, Mike Huckabee. Where is Mike Huckabee? \n\nHe's such -- is he here someplace? He is here. He is so great. Mike, wherever you are, come on out because you are great. I just saw him.\n\nBut we had 17 people of great talent. Ben Carson endorsed us. Mike...\n\nMike endorsed us. Tremendous -- I mean very talented people. And one by one by one -- and they used to say -- well I remember we were down to like 13 or 14. In one state I got 49 percent. And one of these clowns said \"he has not reached the 50 percent mark.\" I got 49 percent with like 14 people. How do you get 49 percent with 14 people? And they said he hasn't reached the 50 percent mark. They're very dishonest people.\n\nSo we ended up with 17 people, right? Don't forget that's hard because nobody else ever had a field that big or that violent, or that violent.\n\nAnd we have a couple that didn't endorse and that's too bad. You know they signed a pledge. They didn't honor it. But...\n\nBut -- no. But for the most part...\n\nNo. For the most part they were very honorable. But it was rough. They said it was the roughest primary every. I would say this is the roughest election.\n\nYou know the NFL ratings are way down. You know why? Because everyone's watching this. It's actually tougher. It's actually tougher. \n\nEveryone's watching. The NFL ratings are way down. A lot of people say it's because of this.\n\nSo you had 17 people. You've came down -- but we've got -- and this is a tribute to everybody in this room. We got the highest number of voters in the history of the Republican primary system. \n\nSo well done. \n\nThat's a long time. You know, starting with Honest Abe Lincoln, right. That's a long time. I got more than Honest Abe. That's really the only thing I did better than Honest Abe. Honest Abe was pretty -- he was pretty good.\n\nSo here's the beauty. You have one day until the election. And it's not even one day. It's a half a day. To make every dream you've ever dreamed for your country and for your family to come true. You have one magnificent chance. And honestly, in four years it's over, folks.\n\nThere has never been a movement like this. Even these dishonest people in the media say there has never -- Bill O'Reilly. He said it's the single greatest political phenomena that he's witnessed in his life. That's a pretty good statement. \n\nBut others have said it. Others have said it. Others have said it. And it's not going to happen again. It won't be able to happen again. Four years it'll never happen. So you got to get out there and you got to vote. Got to get out.\n\nSomebody said what you've done has never been done before. It doesn't matter if you win or lose. I said believe me, it matters. No, they said that. It'll be down in the history books. I said you know what? You may be right about that.\n\nBut if we don't win I will consider this the single greatest waste of time, energy. Wow do I -- you need energy for this. The single greatest waste of time, energy and money.\n\nI have over $100 million. That's a lot of money that I don't take in from the special interests because I don't need it. That's nice.\n\nAnd we have the biggest Internet -- you know the small donors? The small donors are giving us money at record clips. I think we had $82 million and then we had close to $100 million. And it comes in. And I think the average was like $61 each. I love those people. Those are people that love this country. \n\nAnd usually that's for the Democrats. You know in all fairness, that's usually for the Democrats to do that. But we're beating everybody. Nobody's seen anything like what we're doing.\n\nSo we don't want to blow it. We don't want to waste it. Go vote. Go vote. Because believe me, if we don't win, all of us, honestly we've all wasted our time, I'll be honest. Because nothing's going to happen.\n\nThey may say good things about us as a movement. Won't mean a damn thing, folks. You got to go out. We got to vote and we got to win. Change. \n\nChange.\n\nSo you have one magnificent chance to beat the corrupt system that you're witnessing today, and to deliver justice for every forgotten man and woman and child in this nation. Do not let this opportunity slip away. We're fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people, not the donors and not the special interests. \n\nAnd we're fighting, we're fighting to bring us all together as Americans. We're a very divided country. People don't realize we are an unbelievably divided country. We're going to come together.\n\nJust imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one God, saluting one American flag. \n\nJust imagine.\n\nI'm asking you to dream big because with your vote we are just one day away from the change you've been waiting for, for your entire life. \n\nBecause if we win tomorrow, we will be able to make America wealthy again, to make America strong again, to make America safe again, and to make America great again.\n\nGod bless you, everybody. \n\nThank you. God bless you. Thank you, North Carolina. \n\nThank you, folks. Thank you.\u0000","69":"Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Wow.\n\nThank you so very, very much. Wow. I am so happy to be back here and to be here with all of you. I am thrilled. And I can't thank you enough.\n\nAnd it's a special privilege and pleasure to be introduced by my friend and such a great leader, someone who has served not only this state so well, but also our country. And so I want to thank -- once again, I want to thank former senator and former secretary, Ken Salazar.\n\nAnd I also want to thank somebody else who's here who is really special and is doing such a great job for all of you. And that is your senator, and I hope you will get out and send him back to Washington, Michael Bennet.\n\nI also want to recognize someone who's running a great race for congress, Gail Schwartz.\n\nI -- I was thinking -- I was thinking, the first time I came to this beautiful place and had a chance to meet people from here was in 1992.\n\nI was here for somebody else, namely my husband who was running for president.\n\nAnd I know there are a lot of really young people here, but was anybody here back in 1992?\n\nWell, Bill and I talk about Pueblo all the time. And it is always a treat for either one of us to come. And today, it's especially important because we are getting closer and closer and closer to the next election. And we're also very conscious of the fact that here in Colorado for the first time, you are all going to be able to vote by mail.\n\nAnd this Monday, October 17th, ballots will start being mailed to Colorado voters.\n\nNow, if you've already registered to vote, I hope you'll keep your eye open for the mail and fill out your ballot. Send it back as quick as you can. Don't wait to fill it out.\n\nDon't do what I do, put it on the kitchen counter and then you put something else on top of it and something else and pretty soon you're wondering, \"Where is that ballot? I know it cam here a few days ago.\" So please put it in the mail so we can get every early vote counted quickly and avoid a big backlog on election night.\n\nAnd maybe -- if you haven't registered to vote yet, please do it right now. And if you go to Iwillvote.com, you can do that on your phones -- you do that right now -- you can get registered. Pretty easy, huh?\n\nBecause we need everybody to vote in this election. And we need your friends and your family and everyone you can reach, because this is about something so important. I don't know that there's ever been a more serious or consequential election. And we can see that people feel that way, because across America, people are already voting in high numbers.\n\nA lot of states have what's called early vote, and the numbers are bigger than anybody thought. And bigger than they've been in the past.\n\nJust this morning in Ohio, people began lining up last night so they could be sure to vote. They couldn't wait to cast their ballots. And by the time we're done, we expect record numbers of people to vote in this presidential election.\n\nSo don't be left out because we need you. And oh by the way, if you've got friends in Utah or Arizona make sure they vote too. We are competing everywhere and the polls are tightening because I think Americans want to turn out as big a number as possible to reject the dark and divisive and hateful campaign that is being run by my opponent.\n\nAnd you know, your vote can make all the difference. I was in Florida yesterday with former Vice President Gore.\n\nAnd as he said yesterday, take it from him, every vote counts. So don't sit this one out. And I'm very proud of the campaign we've run. I'm proud of the campaign Bernie Sanders and I ran.\n\nIt was about -- it was about issues, not insults. We were setting forth a positive agenda that would help America. And help millions and millions of Americans get ahead and stay ahead.\n\nAnd to me, that is what we're supposed to be doing. We're supposed to bring people together. We're supposed to unify our country. We're supposed to solve our problems by working together.\n\nAnd I know it's been a long race, but as soon as our primary finished, Senator Sanders and I got together and came up with a plan to make college affordable and pay back student debt, provide more healthcare. And we have done our best to stay out of all the meanness.\n\nYou know, the other night -- did you see that last debate?\n\nWell, I was watching my opponent just go lower and lower and lower. And I was reminded of what my friend, and our first lady, Michelle Obama says.\n\nWhen they go low, we go high.\n\nAnd I want you to know I want to be -- I want to be the president for everyone. I am tired of the all the divisions and the barriers. I want to bring people together across our party lines, across any lines that divide us. And not just people who vote for me, I want to be the president, yes, for Democrats, but also Republicans and Independents.\n\nAnd I am very grateful for all of the Republicans who are supporting me. And I am very -- I'm very appreciative of all of the newspapers that are endorsing me, some of whom have never endorsed a Democrat before.\n\nSo we're going to keep running this campaign. I want to give you something to vote for, not just something to vote against.\n\nAnd during these next 28 days, we're going to crisscross our country. We're going to be talking about what we can do together. But Donald Trump is taking a very different tone.\n\nHis campaign -- his campaign said today that they're going to use a, quote, \"scorched Earth\" strategy for the remaining four weeks of this race. Now, that just shows how desperate they are. That's all they have left, pure negativity, pessimism.\n\nAnd we're not going to let Donald Trump get away with it, are we?\n\nI don't care what he says about me. I -- I -- I care about what he says about you. And I'll tell you what, I will stand up and defend every single person in this country from the insults and the disrespect that we hear from him.\n\nNow, the whole world has heard how Donald Trump treats women and what he thinks of women.\n\nAnd he is doubling-down on his excuse that it's just, quote, \"locker room talk.\"\n\nWell, you know what happened? It just kind of happened spontaneously. A lot of athletes and coaches started posting on Twitter and Instagram and Facebook. I mean, the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, the NFL, and more. They are coming together and they're saying, \"That doesn't happen in our locker rooms.\"\n\nBut of course, you know, it's not only women that he has disrespected. He's insulted practically everybody. He went after a distinguished federal judge, Judge Curiel, who was born in Indiana. And Trump said, \"Well, he couldn't be trusted because his parents were Mexican.\"\n\nHe has targeted immigrants, African Americans, Latinos. He's targeted POWs, people with disabilities, moslems, and so many others.\n\nAnd every time he does that I get somebody who is worried or scared, writing me a letter or talking to me. And especially children. It's really who Donald Trump is. But when you scare children, you know, like a little boy. His mother wrote to me. She had adopted him from Ethiopia when he was a toddler. There were a lot of children in Ethiopia that were no longer able to live with families. Their parents, their grandparents were not around. And a lot of Americans have adopted children in need like that and this little boy named Felix is now ten years old. He's only lived in the United States. And his mother wrote me and she said that after hearing Donald Trump, he turned to her and asked, 'Mommy, will he send me back to Ethiopia?'\n\nThat's the kind of fear and anxiety that I hear from immigrant families who are scared to death, especially the children, that Donald Trump is going to put together a big deportation force and go door to door, school to school, business to business, home to home.\n\nAnd it is hard to explain to children. And so I hope that if you know any children who are listening and watching and hearing some of what is said, you will reassure them. I want every boy and girl to know the American dream is big enough for you and there is a place in America for you.\n\nAnd that in this election, we will demonstrate that America is better than what Donald Trump says and represents.\n\nBut here's what I also want to know. We have a big difference about how best to get the economy going. You know, Trump wants to give trillions and trillions in tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires.\n\nYou know, that's called trickle down economics, but as with anything when it comes to Donald Trump, he wants to have the biggest tax breaks for the wealthy and corporations than we have ever, ever had. So I believe differently. We're going to invest in the middle class. We're going to invest in you, in your jobs, in your future.\n\nWell, you know, you do have to feel a little sorry for them. They've had a really bad couple of weeks.\n\nBut you know, part of the difference in how we see the economy I think comes from our experiences. You know, Donald grew up the son of a millionaire. He got started in business by borrowing $14 million from his dad. So it's not a surprise he wants to keep giving back to the wealthy, because that's his own experience. I grew up differently. My father was a factory worker. Well, my grandfather was a factory worker. My father was a small businessman. I know how hard they worked and I am grateful for the middle class life that they gave us, and that's what I want to make sure everybody gets.\n\nThat's why I believe we've got to get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top, and we're going to focus on those issues. We're going to make it possible to have more good jobs in infrastructure. We need to fix our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports and our airports.\n\nAnd we need to make sure that the rich pay their fair share because here's what we've learned, Donald Trump hasn't paid a penny in federal income tax in years.\n\nNow this is all allegedly because of course we don't know for sure because he won't release his income taxes but it's allegedly because he lost $1 billion running casinos. Now I ask you, who loses $1 billion running casinos, right?\n\nDo you know how hard that is? But think about it, it means he's contributed zero. Zero for our military, zero for our vets, zero for education and health and he has the gall to go around disrespecting our military.\n\nHe calls the United States military a disaster.\n\nWell the only disaster is somebody who can get away with paying no taxes and have the gall to run for president and criticize all the rest of us who have done our part to support America.\n\nNow, you've all heard his slogan, Make America Great Again, right? Well that would have maybe some truth to it if he made anything in America and if he bought things that are made in America. There are so many examples but let me just give you one, which is close to your hearts, because Pueblo is one of the largest steel producing cities in America, right?\n\nSo you know how important it is to support our steel workers and our steel industry.\n\nNow, Trump is the guy who went around for a year talking about how he was on the side of workers and all the rest of it. No truth to it, but you know, he did say it over and over again and we've slowly but surely uncovered how little he's done to help anybody except Donald Trump.\n\nAnd he has bought Chinese steel for his buildings. Not American steel. He could be buying American steel, he should be buying American steel. If he wants to make America great again, start by America with American steel.\n\nI have a very different idea and in addition to jobs and infrastructure, which uses American steel, we're going to do more on advanced manufacturing, on technology and innovation, on clean energy jobs and we're going to make the economy fairer at the same time. And here's what I want the young people and their families to hear.\n\nSenator Sanders and I got together on a plan. We are going to make public college tuition free for working families and debt free for everyone else.\n\nIf you already have debt because you're trying to get your education, we're going to help you refinance it. It is wrong that you could refinance a home and refinance car but you can't refinance your student debt. And we're going to make it possible for you to pay it back as a percentage of your income.\n\nNow, based on this plan, we will save millions of people thousands of dollars, and you can go to hillaryclinton.com\/calculator to see how much you and your family can save. Because we want to liberate young people and families from the burden of college debt.\n\nAnd we're also gonna make the economy fairer by raising the national minimum wage so people who work full-time won't be in poverty.\n\nAnd we're going to expand Social Security for those who need it the most - low income seniors and widowed women.\n\nAnd we are going to pass comprehensive immigration reform.\n\nI'm going to introduce reform. I can't wait to work with Senator Bennet, I can't wait to have a chance to make sure that we are working on immigration reform from the very beginning. We're gonna finally help dreamers achieve their dream of following their future and becoming American citizens.\n\nI also think it is past time, don't you, to guarantee equal pay for women's work?\n\nYou know I started talking about equal pay years and years and years ago because it's not only a woman's issue it's a family issue. If you have a wife or a daughter or a mother or a sister it's your issue. Right? You know that.\n\nSo Donald Trump always says, you know I'm playing the woman card. And my response is pretty simple. If being for equal pay and affordable childcare and paid family leave is playing the woman's card, then deal me in.\n\nYou see I am very excited, I am very excited about what we could do. You know I give President Obama a lot of credit. He inherited the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. I remember, because he called and asked me to come see him shortly after the election.\n\nAnd I didn't know why. He wanted me to be secretary of state but I didn't know that. But I got there and the first thing he says is, \"It's so much worse than they told us.\"\n\nAnd it was. You remember. It was terrible. Millions of people lost their jobs and homes were lost and it was just a horrible time. We have dug ourselves out of that ditch, thanks to everybody's hard work.\n\nAnd we can't ever go back there because believe me, trickle-down economics and refusing to regulate Wall Street and the mortgage market is what got us into that mess in the first place.\n\nAnd Donald Trump wants to get rid of the new rules on Wall Street. He wants to get rid of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which returns money to people who've been defrauded by big companies. Well I have a totally different view.\n\nWe're gonna keep those and then we're going to tell companies that try to move jobs out of our country that if they try to they're gonna have to pay an exit tax and return every penny, every penny, of tax benefit they've ever gotten.\n\nAnd I've been very clear about how we're gonna pay for what I want to do. It is going to be going after the wealthy, closing the loopholes on corporations.\n\nI can pledge to you, I will never raise middle class federal taxes. It is not right.\n\nAnd what I've been trying to do listening to people around the country is figure out what we can do to help you with what I call kitchen table issues. And we thank you very much.\n\nWhat - right now - thank you.\n\nYou know, I always feel so welcome when I come to Pueblo. I think I'll come here anytime it gets hard in the White House. What do you say?\n\nFinally I want to tell you that I want to make it easier for you to raise your kids. You know, there is nothing more important.\n\nI'm now a grandmother of two wonderful grandchildren, a little girl, a little boy. And there are too many hard-working families struggling with the cost of raising children.\n\nSo right now most families with kids get something called the child tax credit. It gives a middle-class family $1000 per child to help you defray the costs. I'm going to double - I'm going to double the child tax credit.\n\nThat's another $1,000 for young kids to pay for the things you need, whether it's child care, housing, prescription drugs, groceries, or anything else, it is just one example of the tax relief I want to give to working families and we're going to make sure that it gets to the people who need it most.\n\nWe're going to lift families out of poverty. In fact, the changes I am proposing we think will automatically help more people get out of poverty and we're going to look for other ways to help you.\n\nWhat I am interested in is your success, your futures, your possibilities, your dreams. I want to be a president who makes it possible for more people to feel like they are really moving and their kids are going to have better lives.\n\nThat is how I was raised. That's what I want for you and every single family, every single child in America!\n\nSo we have about four weeks ago. It's going to be - it's going to be a race to the finish line, my friends. And here is what I want to ask you.\n\nAs I said in the beginning, think about everything that is important to you, whether it is jobs and rising incomes, whether it is education, healthcare, whatever it might be. Whether it is protecting our rights.\n\nPeople who have fought so hard, whether it is immigration reform, whatever it might be, think about it because you know what?\n\nThose issues will be on the ballot. They may not be listed there, but you could not have two more different people running for president than me and Donald Trump.\n\nAnd I know that if people turn out, I know if people show up, we're going to win and we're going to be able to do everything I've talked about.\n\nAnd so it call comes to down whether or not you take that ballot you get in the mail, you fill it in, you send it back, you do everything you can to make sure that your vote will be counted.\n\nYou know, when I think about this election, I do think about my grandchildren a lot. Yeah, you, too, right?\n\nI'll tell you what, for those of you who aren't grandparents yet, it is an incredible experience. Right?\n\nAnd there is nothing I wouldn't do for them. As I like to say, face time was invented for grandparents, and you get to check in and see how they're doing. But more than that, what kind of lives are they going to have and what kind of country is going to be waiting for them?\n\nI know how important it is that families and communities and our country stand behind every child. Make sure every child has a good education, a good school, good teachers, and every zip code in America. Make sure every child -- every child has the healthcare that he or she needs. That's why I work to create the Children's Health Insurance Program, so we can take care of millions of children.\n\nThat's why every family deserves to have a good job with a good income to be able to be good providers for their kids.\n\nI got into this work so many years ago. I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund, right out of law school. And I spent my time trying to figure out how you even the odds for all kids. And the reason I did that is because of my own mother.\n\nI didn't know it when I was just a little girl, but I learned as I got older that my mother was abandoned and neglected by her parents and pretty much left on her own, and then at the age of eight, holding her little three-year-old sister's hand, she was put on a train by themselves to go to California to live with grandparents.\n\nIt turned out the grandparents didn't really want her either. So by the age of 14, she was working in a house as a maid and a babysitter. But here's what I want you to know. It sounds pretty harsh. It was difficult. It made a profound impression on her life. I think my mom, who lived to the wonderful age of 92, I don't think there was a day that went by that she didn't think about being abandoned and being sent away and being pretty much left on her own.\n\nBut, along the way, people were kind to her. People helped her. The first grade teacher who brought lunch for her every day, because my mother never had any -- the woman whose house she went to work in all those years ago knew my mother wanted to go to high school, so she said to her, Dorothy, if you get up early and you get your chores done, you can go to high school.\n\nNow, you'll have to come right back home. That might sound kind of unfortunate, but for my mom, it was a gift, because she really wanted to go to high school.\n\nAnd so my mother always cared about other people. And she taught me in every way she could that nobody is better than anybody else, right.\n\nAnd we need to show each other more kindness and support. And the last thing we need in our country are more bullies making people feel bad about themselves and pushing people away, we should be drawing people toward us.\n\nWe should be creating the kind of future we want for every one of our children. That's what I think about when I imagine, if I'm so fortunate enough to become president, I think about waking up -- waking up --\n\nI think about waking up in the White House every morning trying to figure out what can I do to help somebody else and who can I work with? How many families and communities across America will work with us to come up with ideas that give every single child the chance to live up to his or her God given potential?\n\nThat's what I think we are called to do. Whether you're a person of faith or not, the American dream is really premised on people coming together to lift each other up. Nobody, nobody makes it alone. Everybody has somebody who helps them along the way.\n\nSo let's pull together, Pueblo, let's get out and vote for the kind of positive future we want for ourselves and our children. God bless you, thank you.\u0000","70":"It is great to be here in Charlotte to discuss an issue that means so much to me.\nThat is the issue of urban renewal, and the rebuilding of our inner cities.\n\nToday I want to talk about how to grow the African-American middle class, and to provide a new deal for Black America. That deal is grounded in three promises: safe communities, great education, and high-paying jobs.\n\nMy vision rests on a principle that has defined this campaign: America First.\n\nEvery African-American citizen in this country is entitled to a government that puts their jobs, wages and security first.\n\nI'm asking today for the honor of your vote, and the privilege to represent you as your President. Here is the promise I make to you: whether you vote for me or not, I will be your greatest champion. I have no special interest, I take no orders from donors or lobbyists - I work for you, and only you.\n\nOur campaign is about change, optimism, and the future. I am asking people to break from the bitter failures of the past, and to imagine the amazing possibilities for our future.\n\nOur opponent represents the rigged system and failed thinking of yesterday. Her campaign offers only the depressing pessimism that says this is as good as it gets, that nothing can ever really change.\n\nHillary has been there for 30 years and hasn't fixed anything - she's just made it worse.\n\nAmerican politics is caught in a time loop - we keep electing the same people, who keep making the same mistakes, and who keep offering the same excuses.\n\nThe fact that our corrupt Washington establishment has tried so hard to stop our movement is just more proof that we represent the kind of change that arrives only once in a lifetime.\n\nEvery day I'm out on the trail proposing fresh solutions and new thinking. And every day, the same people, getting rich off our broken system, tell us that we can't change and that we can't try anything new.\n\nI have a message for all the doubters in Washington: America's future belongs to the dreamers, not the cynics.\n\nAnd it's time to extend that dream to every African-American citizen in this country.\n\nAfrican-American citizens have sacrificed so much for this nation. They have fought and died in every war since the Revolution, and from the pews and the picket lines they have lifted up the conscience of our country in the long march for Civil Rights.\n\nYet, too many African-Americans have been left behind.\n\n45% of African-American children under the age of 6 live in poverty.\n\n58% of African-American youth are not currently employed.\n\nAfrican-Americans compromise roughly 13 percent of the population, yet make-up 60% of murder victims under the age of 22.\n\nIn 2015, violent crime in Charlotte increased by 18 percent - and it's expected to rise 24% in 2016.\n\nIn the city of Chicago, nearly 3,500 people have been shot since January of this year.\n\nThe conditions in our inner cities today are unacceptable.\n\nThe Democrats have run our inner cities for fifty, sixty, seventy years or more. They've run the school boards, the city councils, the mayor's offices, and the congressional seats. Their policies have failed, and they've failed miserably.\n\nThey've trapped children in failing government schools, and opposed school choice at every turn.\n\nThe Clintons gave us NAFTA and China's entry into the World Trade Organization, two deals that de-industrialized America, uprooted our industry, and stripped bare towns like Detroit and Baltimore and the inner cities of North Carolina. This state has lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs since Bill and Hillary's NAFTA, decimating the African-American middle class.\n\nDemocratic policies have also given rise to crippling crime and violence.\n\nThen there is the issue of taxation and regulation. Massive taxes, massive regulation of small business, and radical restrictions on American energy, have driven jobs and opportunities out of our inner cities. Hillary wants to raise taxes on successful small businesses as high as 45 percent - which will only drive more jobs out of your community, and into other countries.\n\nOne of the greatest betrayals has been the issue of immigration. Illegal immigration violates the civil rights of African-Americans. No group has been more economically-harmed by decades of illegal immigration than low-income African-American workers. Hillary's pledge to enact \"open borders,\" - made in secret to a foreign bank - would destroy the African-American middle class.\n\nAt the center of my revitalization plan is the issue of trade. Massive, chronic trade deficits have emptied out our jobs. Just look at what has happened to Baltimore, Detroit, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, and right here in North Carolina. It's the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.\n\nIf I'm President, and the executives at Ford Motor Company announce they are moving their plants and jobs to Mexico, I will pick up the phone and make a simple call. I will tell those executives that if they move their factories to Mexico, I will put a 35% tax on their product before they ship it back into the United States. We won't let your jobs be stolen from you anymore. When we stop the offshoring to low-wage countries, we raise wages at home - meaning rent and bills become instantly more affordable.\n\nAt the same time, my plan to lower the business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent will bring thousands of new companies onto our shores. It also includes a massive middle class tax cut, tax-free childcare savings accounts, and childcare tax deductions and credits.\n\nI will also propose tax holidays for inner-city investment, and new tax incentives to get foreign companies to relocate in blighted American neighborhoods. I will further empower cities and states to seek a federal disaster designation for blighted communities in order to initiate the rebuilding of vital infrastructure, the demolition of abandoned properties, and the increased presence of law enforcement.\n\nI will also pursue financial reforms to make it easier for young African-Americans to get credit to pursue their dreams in business and create jobs in their communities. Dodd-Frank has been a disaster, making it harder for small businesses to get the credit they need. The policies of the Clintons brought us the financial recession - through lifting Glass-Steagall, pushing subprime lending, and blocking reforms to Fannie and Freddie. It's time for a 21st century Glass Steagall and, as part of that, a priority on helping African-American businesses get the credit they need.\n\nWe will also encourage small-business creation by allowing social welfare workers to convert poverty assistance into repayable but forgive-able micro-loans.\n\nThen there is the issue of public safety. Making our communities safe again will be a priority for the Trump Administration.\n\nI have heard and have listened to the concerns raised by African-American citizens about our justice system, and I promise that under a Trump Administration the law will be applied fairly, equally and without prejudice. There will be only one set of rules - not a two-tiered system of justice. The best evidence of unequal justice is that Hillary Clinton could violate so many laws, bleach and delete 33,000 emails after a Congressional subpoena, lie to Congress and the FBI - put our national security at grave risk - and not even face so much as a fine.\n\nEqual justice also means the same rules for Wall Street. The Obama Administration never held Wall Street accountable.\n\nWe will also police our streets. I want every poor African-American child to be able to walk down the street in peace. Safety is a civil right. The problem is not the presence of police but the absence of police. I will invest in training and funding both local and federal law enforcement operations to remove the gang members, drug dealers, and criminal cartels from our neighborhoods. The reduction of crime is not merely a goal - but a necessity. We will get it done. The war on police urged on by my rival is reckless, and dangerous, and puts African-American lives at risk. We must work with our police, not against them.\n\nOn immigration, my policy is simple. I will restore the civil rights of African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and all Americans, by ending illegal immigration. I will reform visa rules to give American workers preference for jobs, and I will suspend reckless refugee admissions from terror-prone regions that cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars. A portion of the money saved by enforcing our laws, and suspending refugees, will be re-invested in our inner cities. It is time to help the American citizens who have become refugees in their own country.\n\nInfrastructure will be another major goal. My contract calls for $1 trillion dollars in infrastructure investment, of which the inner cities will be a major beneficiary.\n\nI will also cancel all wasteful climate change spending from Obama-Clinton, including all global warming payments to the United Nations. These steps will save $100 billion over 8 years, and this money will be used to help rebuild the vital infrastructure, including water systems, in America's inner cities.\n\nSchool choice is at the center of my plan. My proposal redirects education spending to allow every disadvantaged child in America to attend the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school of their choice. School choice is the great civil rights issue of our time, and I will be the nation's biggest cheerleader for school choice in all 50 states. I will also appoint a commission to investigate the school to prison pipeline and to shut it down and create a new pathway that leads from a great education to a great job. My plan will also ensure funding for Historical Black Colleges and Universities, more affordable 2 and 4-year college, and support for trade and vocational education.\n\nFinally, today, my agenda includes the protection of religious liberty, the promotion of family, and support for the African-American church.\n\nThis is just the beginning. Because I will never, ever take the African-American community for granted. It will be my mission to prove to this country that yesterday does not have to be tomorrow. The cycle of poverty can be broken, and great new things can happen for our people.\n\nBut to achieve this future, we must reject the failed elites in Washington who've been wrong about virtually everything for decades.\n\nThe people opposing us promised that passing NAFTA, and opening our markets to China, would bring a new era of prosperity and job creation. Instead, they brought only poverty and heartache.\n\nThe people opposing us are the same people who've wasted $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East that have produced only more terrorism, more death, and more suffering - imagine if that money had been spent at home.\n\nMy opponent unleashed ISIS on the world. She tried to build Democracy in Libya, and failed. She tried to build Democracy in Iraq, and failed. She tried regime change in Egypt, and failed. She pressed regime change in Syria, and failed. She tried a Russian Reset that failed. She tried an Asia Pivot that failed. Now, Hillary Clinton wants to confront nuclear-armed Russia with a shooting war in Syria that could lead us into World War III.\n\nFinally, our opponents passed a healthcare law, embraced by Hillary Clinton, over the furious objections of the American voter. Obamacare is now destroying our healthcare system - premiums are skyrocketing double-digits and are surging by more than 100% in the great state of Arizona. Doctors are quitting, insurers are leaving, and companies are fleeing. Every prediction they made about this law was a lie. If we don't repeal and replace this disastrous law, we will lose our healthcare system forever.\n\nNow is the time to embrace a New Direction.\n\nI've been very lucky and have led a great life. Now I want to give back to the country which has been so good to me. I just left a hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington D.C., delivered under budget, and ahead of schedule, creating thousands of jobs, including construction. It will be one of the finest hotels anywhere in the world, and a great symbol for our country. I took two hours to fly into Washington, to cut the ribbon with my children, and then jump on the plane to be here with you. I wanted to be there for my children, who worked so hard on this hotel -- parents must stick with, encourage, and support their children. They did a great job on the hotel, and I told them so. Likewise, the workers did a magnificent job -- without them, it could never have been built so quickly and so beautifully. The rebuilding we did of the Old Post Office is the rebuilding I want to do for our country.\n\nI want to go into the inner cities, the poor rural communities, and the failing schools, and I want to work on a national plan for revitalization. I'm tired of the excuses from our politicians. I'm tired of being told what can't be done. I'm tired of people asking Americans to defer their dreams to another day, but really another decade.\n\nEnough waiting. The time is now. There is nothing we can't accomplish. There is no task or project too great. There is no dream outside our reach.\n\nEverywhere I go in this country, all I see is untapped potential waiting to be set free. But we will never realize that potential if we continue putting our faith in a broken political system that has let us down time and again. We have to choose the more optimistic path - we have to choose to believe not in our politicians, but to believe in ourselves and in our country. If we do that, anything is possible.\n\nI'm asking America to join me in dreaming big and bold things for our future. Let's close the history books on the failures in Washington, and let's open a new chapter of success and prosperity for everyone.\n\nI am humbled beyond words to be the nominee for the Party of Abraham Lincoln. And it is my highest and greatest hope that the Republican Party can be the home of the African-American vote once again.\n\nTogether, we will have a government of, by and for the people.\n\nAnd we will Make America Great Again For All Americans.\u0000","71":"Hello, Toledo. I am - I am very happy to be here today and - I am so grateful to have this chance to talk to you about what we can do together to have the kind of economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.\nI want to acknowledge - we have an overflow crowd in another room, and I know they can hear us, but we're glad they're here. I want to thank your Congresswoman, Marcy Kaptur, for her leadership and her grit. I want to thank Mayor Paula Hicks-Hudson. And the mayor told me there's a young man here who just won a boxing championship, Robert Easter. Where's Robert Easter? There you are, Robert Easter. Congratulations. I know Toledo is proud of you; we all are. I want to thank Kenyetta for that introduction. Do we have any other UAW members here?\n\nIt's a great day to be here in Ohio for a lot of different reasons. One is I am so thrilled that LeBron James has endorsed me and joined our campaign. I know - I've gotten a lot of wonderful endorsements over the past year and a half. I'm grateful for each and every one of them. But I got to say, there's something special about this one. And it's a real honor in part because of why he chose to endorse me. Now, not everyone knows this. I mean, you all know what an amazing athlete he his - MVP, winner of championships - but he's also - LeBron is also a dedicated advocate for children. And this afternoon I'll be in Akron, where he's done so much for the kids in that community.\n\nIt's a deep, personal commitment that he has that I share with him. We both believe every single child should have the chance to live up to his or her God-given potential. I could not be prouder to have LeBron joining our team as we head into the homestretch.\n\nNow, one thing I know - I'll just say it because I know it's for sure - I hope to be elected president, but I know here in Ohio LeBron will always be the King.\n\nI was listening to Kenyetta introduce me, and I really appreciated what she said, because Toledo is the kind of place where people work hard, look after one another, and yes, pay their taxes, right?\n\nYou recognize that we all have to do our part because we are all in this together, and it matters.\n\nWe believe honest work deserves honest pay. We believe everyone should have the right to join a strong union that will always have your back.\n\nIt's personal for me. I'm the granddaughter of a factory worker from Scranton, Pennsylvania. He went to work in the same lace mill every day for 50 years. He believed he passed it down to my dad, who passed it down to me that if he did what he was supposed to do, he'd have a good life and his kids would have an even better life. That is the American dream. That is what we believe in. That's what we've got to keep going generation after generation.\n\nAnd because of my grandfather's hard work, my dad made it to college. And then after serving in the Navy during World War II, he started his own small business, printing fabric for draperies.\n\nAs a young girl, I'd sometimes go to his print plant. It was a long building, no natural light, no windows, but he had these long tables where he'd roll out the fabric and then I'd watch him work with silkscreens, if you've ever seen that. He would take the silkscreen, he'd put it down, he'd pour the paint in, he'd take the squeegee, go across all the way down to the end of one table, then over to the next table, all the way back. And then if there was a second color to be added, he would do that. He sometimes let me help with the squeegee. That was my favorite part.\n\nAnd I know he worked really hard. He worked really hard. He believed in hard work. He passed that on to me. He provided a good middle-class life for us. So I am proud to stand with hardworking families all over Toledo, Ohio, and America, who should have the same chance that I did to share in the American Dream, which should be big enough for everybody.\n\nFighting for kids and families has been the cause of my life, as Kenyetta said, when I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund all those years ago. And it will be the mission of my presidency, because I want to focus on what are called kitchen table issues, the ones that keep you up at night - like the cost of child care, and college, and prescription drugs, and so much else.\n\nAnd that means we've got to create more good jobs with rising incomes. That means we've got to have good schools in every zip code. That means everybody willing to work - and I say that very clearly; you've got to be willing to work - and if you're willing to work, you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead. That is the basic bargain.\n\nNow, I don't know about you, but you wouldn't think that the theme of my campaign, 'getting an economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top' would be controversial - and yet this is one of the defining debates not just of this election but of our time.\n\nNow, I will say, most American companies - most - are run by honorable, patriotic people who care about their employees and communities. But there are still too many powerful interests fighting to protect their own profits and privileges at the expense of everyone else.  And they are aided and abetted by the rules and incentives in our economy who actually encourage people at the top to take advantage of consumers, workers, small businesses, and taxpayers.\n\nThat makes it tougher for the well-meaning CEOs to take the high road. And it gets even harder when we don't aggressively enforce the rules, when we don't enforce trade rules that allow other countries with lower wages and standards to get an unfair leg up, when we don't enforce rules on Wall Street, which exerts enormous pressure on publicly traded companies to prioritize boosting share prices in the short term over building real value, investing in workers, plant, and equipment over the longer term.\n\nAnd let's be honest, the tax code rewards corporations for outsourcing jobs and their profits overseas instead of investing here in the United States. And it is riddled with loopholes that let the rich get even richer and make income inequality even worse. It tilts the playing field further against small businesses that can't afford lawyers and lobbyists.\n\nSo with all these pressures pushing in the wrong direction, it's even more important that we have an election about these very issues. Because what I know will happen - if we have an election where we have an agenda that actually would begin to level that playing field, we will rebuild the middle class, we will make work pay, we will create greater opportunities for a great percentage of Americans.\n\nNow, I know how hard this, but I think we are on the cusp, if we win this election, to be able to get these things done, right?\n\nThat means pursuing reforms that unleash the enormous positive potential of the American private sector. We've got unmatched talent, innovation, entrepreneurial spirit.\n\nSo when we work together, we can all benefit.\n\nNow, I believe corporations that benefit from everything America has to offer should feel some sense of responsibility not just to their biggest shareholders - but to their workers, to their customers, to their communities, and yes, to our country, to the United States of America. We have been moving off track for decades. I don't need to tell you that. You know it, you've lived it, you've seen it. But it is time to get back on track.\n\nAnd you can ask anybody who's ever worked for me or worked with me, who's ever served with me, when I tell you I'm going to try to do something, I will get up every single day and work my heart out for you.\n\nSo let's begin by making it clear that for most businesses, America is the most important asset on their balance sheet. This country of ours, this system of ours, the rule of law, the opportunity to get an education and go as far as your hard work and ambition will take you. And we created the biggest engine of economic growth in the world, the American middle class. So when we middle class thrives, the country thrives. And when it doesn't, we don't, right?\n\nAnd I'm going to use the White House and every tool at my disposal as your president to make the case that patriotism is profitable. Standing up for America, investing in America will pay off.\n\nNow, we have always had innovators and entrepreneurs who build great companies and create real value. But we should not and we will not respect those who get rich by cheating everybody else.\n\nSo today I want to send a clear message to every boardroom, every executive suite across America: If you scam your customers, exploit your employees, pollute our environment, or rip off taxpayers, we will find ways to hold you accountable.\n\nBut on the other side - on the other side, if you do the right thing and you invest in your workers and your communities and our country's future, we will stand with you. That is the choice. Our goal is to make it easier for everyone to do better.\n\nNow, to understand why this is so important, consider the recent examples we've seen of egregious corporate behavior.\n\nLook at Wells Fargo. Really shocking, isn't it? One of the nation's biggest banks bullying thousands of employees into committing fraud against unsuspecting customers, secretly opening up millions of accounts for people without their consent, even their knowledge, misusing personal information, and then sticking customers with hidden fees. It is outrageous that eight years after a cowboy culture on Wall Street wrecked our economy, we are still seeing powerful bankers playing fast and loose with the law.\n\nAnd then in a category by himself, there's Donald Trump. Well, you may have heard that he has long refused to release his tax returns the way every other nominee for president has done for decades. You can look at 40 years of my tax returns. I think we need a law that says if you become the nominee of the major parties, you have to release your tax returns.\n\nNow, a lot of us were wondering, what is he hiding? It must be really terrible. Well, The New York Times has discovered at least part of the answer. Back in the 1990s, Trump apparently lost a billion dollars in a single year on bad investments and failing casinos. Now, how anybody can lose a dollar, let alone a billion dollars, in the casino industry is kind of beyond me. It's just hard to figure. But as a result, it doesn't look like he paid a dime of federal income tax for almost two decades.\n\nNow, while millions of American families, including mine and yours, were working hard paying our fair share, it seems he was contributing nothing to our nation. Imagine that. Not fair. Nothing for Pell Grants to help kids go to college. Nothing for veterans. Nothing for our military. And you know, he has been dissing America in this whole campaign. Right? He talks us down. He makes disparaging comments about our country. He calls our military a disaster. Well, it's not, but it might have been if everybody else had failed to pay taxes to support our brave men and women in uniform.\n\nI saw a newspaper article. A gentleman named Steve Crouse, who owns the Glass City Cafe here in Toledo, summed it up pretty well in this article. He said, 'I would feel guilty if I didn't pay anything. It's flat-out cheating the government.' Now, my friend Bernie Sanders was right yesterday when he said Trump reflects a distorted view of the American people and what this country is all about.\n\nTrump represents the same rigged system that he claims he's going to change. The whole story tells us everything we need to know about how Trump does business. After he made all those bad bets and lost all that money, he didn't lift a finger to help and protect his employees, or all the small businesses and contractors he'd hired, or the people of Atlantic City. They all got hammered while he was busy with his accountants trying to figure out how he could keep living like a billionaire. And all the while he was using his political connections to collect hundreds of millions of dollars in government subsidies and extra tax breaks for his companies. In other words, Trump was taking from America with both hands and leaving the rest of us with the bill.\n\nNow, he says that he's the one who can fix things, but that is like letting the fox guard the henhouse. Right? And here's what I really am just stunned by. I get stunned every day in this campaign. But here's one of the many things that I'm stunned by. He has put forth a tax plan that would cut his own taxes even more. It would be like you're paying zero. You expect us to pay you to stay in business, all the rest of us in America? He'd open the loopholes even wider. And according to a new independent study, he would actually - listen to this, people, because this is a real shocker - his plan would actually raise taxes for millions of middle class families. And you know the people it would hit the hardest? Are single parents, whose lives and challenges he doesn't care about, certainly doesn't understand.\n\nNow, many have likely already spent years paying more than he did, and he now would make that even worse. And what does he say about it? Well, did you all see the debate last Monday? Well, in the debate - in the debate - well, then you all know that in the debate he said it was smart to avoid paying taxes. Yesterday his campaign was bragging it makes him a genius. Here's my question: What kind of genius loses a billion dollars in a single year?\n\nThis is Trump to a T. He's taken corporate excess and makes a business model out of it. He abuses his power, games the system, puts his own interests ahead of the country's. It's Trump first and everyone else last. And there are lots of principled, law-abiding business leaders out there who are horrified by all of this. Not a single - not a single CEO of a Fortune 100 company supports Trump's campaign. Think about it. I've been endorsed by very successful people - Warren Buffett, Mike Bloomberg, Mark Cuban. I loved what Mark Cuban said when he endorsed me. He said, 'Look, I've been successful.' He actually is a real billionaire. And you know what? He used profit-sharing to help his employees, not bankruptcy to fire people. And when he sold his first company, he shared the profits with his employees, and 300 of them became millionaires. That's the kind of business practices I want to see more of in our country.\n\nBut here's what we've got to do. Even if Trump is like one of a kind, we've got to reverse the broader trends he represents. It's time to rewrite the rules and make this economy fair for everyone. And today I want to briefly share with you my plan for protecting taxpayers, consumers, small businesses, and workers. We're going to crack down on the worst corporate abuses and empower companies willing to take the high road and invest in good jobs, in higher wages, and in stronger communities.\n\nFirst let's start with protecting taxpayers and making sure we have more fairness in the system. It is wrong that corporations and the super-wealthy play by a different set of rules. A Wall Street money manager should not be able to pay a lower tax rate than a teacher or a nurse. And I'll tell you something else. Our largest companies should not be able to get away with paying hardly anything at all. It is insulting when they engage in these games, like moving their headquarters over to a foreign country - on paper, not in reality - just to take advantage of lower tax rates. And it is infuriating when they take tax breaks with one hand and give out pink slips in America with the other hand.\n\nSo here's what we're going to do. We're going to close those loopholes. I've got a list of them we're going after. We're going to make Wall Street corporations and the super-rich start paying their fair share of taxes. We're going to pass something called the Buffett rule, which means multimillionaires cannot lower rates than their secretaries and other people working for them. We're going to put in place a new exit tax. If companies try to leave our country to avoid paying their fair share, if they try to outsource jobs, they're going to have to give back every tax break they ever received in our country. And then we're going to put that money to work creating opportunities here in America.\n\nSecond, we're going to protect consumers. No American should ever be taken advantage of, like thousands were, by Wells Fargo. And this isn't a new fight for me. As a Senator, I raised the alarm about subprime mortgages. I fought to hold reckless managers accountable for toxic toys and household products that threaten our kids. I introduced legislation to protect Americans' personal data and combat identity theft. So as president, I will make consumer protection a top priority across the entire government.\n\nAnd that starts by defending and empowering the Consumer Financial Protection Bu-reau, which was created after the financial crisis. And the principal person who got it created was Senator Elizabeth Warren. And under the leadership of Ohio's Rich Cordray, the agency has already returned more than $11 billion to more than 15 million Americans who were ripped off by predatory lenders, credit card companies, and others. And it is the one making sure that the defrauded Wells Fargo customers get their money back.\n\nNow, I got to say I am so proud of what this new agency has done. Sometimes people say, well, what does the government really do? Well, there's a lot of examples, but this is a primary one, standing up and making sure consumers get paid back when they are ripped off. And because of its success, Republicans in Congress keep trying to shut it down. And Donald Trump agrees with them. In fact, he wants to scrap all the tough new rules imposed on Wall Street after the crisis. Well, not on my watch, Donald. We're never going to let that happen.\n\nNow, instead of gutting consumer protection, we should be expanding it. And we should build on the Dodd-Frank financial reforms and go even further because Wall Street can never, ever be permitted to threaten Main Street again. And the Wells Fargo scandal sheds light on another threat to consumers that we have to address. When the scam's victims, people like you and me, who had accounts there tried to sue, they were shocked to learn there was a provision in the very fine print of their contracts that kept them from going to court to sue the bank for being cheated. Instead, they are forced into a closed-door arbitration process without the important protections that you get in a court of law. We are not going to let corporations like Wells Fargo use these fine print \"gotchas\" to escape accountability.\n\nAnd in fact, this is now common practice across a lot of industries - from nursing homes, nursing homes that mistreat seniors, to for-profit colleges that defraud students. Who reads all that fine print? I don't. And you get defrauded or you get mistreated, and then all of a sudden they say, 'Well, you can't sue us.' So we're going to rein in that abuse across everybody.\n\nWe also see a similar problem in some international trade agreements, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership. It sets up a dispute resolution system that favors large corporations over everyone else. It's one of the reasons I'm against it. I've warned about this for years, I've written about it, and I oppose TPP now, I will oppose it after the election, I will oppose it as president - because it is one-sided and unfair to American workers.\n\nAnd what about all those pharmaceutical companies that jack up prices for no reason? We're going to have to protect ourselves against that too. And when we find unjustified spikes in the prices of longstanding, life-saving drugs, we should slap penalties on companies trying to cheat people who need those drugs.\n\nAnd let's finally import safe alternatives from other countries, like Canada, and speed up approvals to get more generic drugs on the market. And it is long past time to allow Medicare to negotiate for better prices for drugs and get the cost down for Medicare recipients. And I believe we should cap the amount working families pay out of pocket every month for medicine. No one should ever have to choose between paying the rent and filling their prescriptions.\n\nSo let's stand up for taxpayers. Let's stand up for consumers. And let's stand up for small businesses, which create most of the jobs in America. I take this personally be-cause of my dad's very small business. We need fair rules of the road so big corporations can't use their power to gain unfair advantages.\n\nNow, when it comes to bullying small businesses, Donald Trump is the poster boy. I have heard so many stories of contractors, and I've met some too, who worked for him, produced the goods and services, and never got paid for what they were owed. I'm talking about painters, and plumbers, piano sellers, architects, glass installers - he stiffed them all. Not because he couldn't pay them, but he wouldn't pay them. And he told them, 'You want to get your money? Sue me.' My dad could never have done that. I'm just grateful my dad never got a contract with Donald Trump, because I don't know what we would have done.\n\nMore than 60 percent of small businesses face payment delays. That can cause a serious cash flow crisis. So as president, I will explore new ways to arm small businesses with the tools to fight back and level the playing field. Part of the problem is large corporations are amassing so much power in our economy. Sometimes it's called market concentration or even old-fashioned monopolies, but either way it threatens businesses of all sizes, as well as consumers. With less competition, corporations can use their power to raise prices, limit choice for consumers, cut wages for workers, crowd out startups and small businesses.\n\nI mean, look what's happening right now. In most of the country, the three largest health insurance companies in each state control 80 percent of the market. No wonder premiums are going up. As president, I will appoint tough, independent authorities to strengthen anti-trust enforcement and really scrutinize mergers and acquisitions, so the big don't keep getting bigger and bigger.\n\nI want every business to compete and thrive, and then I also want to do something else. Let's protect and empower workers who actually drive our economy. Everyone who works hard should be able to share in the rewards, not just senior executives. So we're proposing new tax credits to encourage more companies to share profits, on top of, not instead of, higher wages.\n\nWe need to support new organizing strategies for employees who too often have never had the benefit of collective bargaining. And we have to resist the assault on workers' rights. Let's say loudly and clearly: 'right to work' is wrong for workers and wrong for America.\n\nLet's also, my friends, let's raise the minimum wage and support the Fight for 15 so you don't live in poverty. Let's defend overtime and go after wage theft. Let's provide family leave that is paid and access to affordable, high-quality childcare. And of course you know what I'm going to say: let's finally guarantee equal pay for women.\n\nNow, my opponent and his chief surrogates like to say I'm playing the woman's card. And I'll tell you - right? - if fighting for working families is playing the women's card, you know what? Deal me in!\n\nAnd then finally, I've got a lot on my mind, but finally, we need to make it easier for companies to invest in good jobs here at home. As president, I will ramp up enforcement of trade rules by appointing a new chief trade prosecutor and tripling the number of enforcement officers. We will work with both parties to pass the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II. I want to direct $10 billion to create a 'Make It in America' partnership to support American manufacturing. And I want to take some of the ideas that worked when my husband was President and we ended up with 23 million new jobs and incomes went up for everybody.\n\nThat includes incentives like the New Markets Tax Credit for creating good jobs in poor or remote areas, from inner cities to rural communities ravaged - ravaged - by hollowed-out factories, ravaged by mines that have been shut down, ravaged by opiate addiction. It all comes down to this: When I say our economy should work for everyone, not just those at the top, I mean it. And we're going to do everything we can to make sure workers are treated like assets, not costs. And we're going to bring back infrastructure jobs, advanced manufacturing jobs, clean, renewable energy jobs, innovation, technology, small business.\n\nNow, you don't have to look any further than right here in Northwest Ohio. Just a few years ago, as you heard Kenyetta say, in 2009 you were in the eye of the storm. Jobs, homes, savings, wiped out. The auto industry on the verge of collapse. A lot of people were ready to give up on it. Well, that would have meant giving up on 850,000 people across this state whose jobs were tied to the industry. Donald Trump, for one, said rescuing the auto industry didn't matter very much. Either way would have been acceptable, he said. 'We could have just let it go,' and that's a direct quote from him. Everybody in Ohio who's thinking about voting for Trump needs to hear that. At the time of the worst financial crisis in Ohio in 2009, he would have let you twist and fall. And for his running mate he picked Mike Pence, an ardent opponent of the auto rescue. Well, thank goodness the people of Northwest Ohio weren't ready to let it go. You never gave up. You didn't lose faith. And now, after a lot of hard work and sacrifice, the auto industry just had its best year ever.\n\nBut that's not all there is to the story because in addition to that hard work, America, America, came to the rescue. Taxpayers like all of us, not him but us, provided the funds for the rescue. Union workers stepped up. Communities like Toledo came together to make it work. And now that the industry's back on its feet, the auto companies have a responsibility to give back.\n\nSo I was delighted to hear that Chrysler is doubling down on Toledo, investing $700 million here to start building the next generation Jeep Wrangler, which could create about 700 new good jobs. And tens of thousands of UAW workers at Chrysler plants should see a big increase in profit-sharing payments above and beyond wages and benefits. Now, that's the way it's supposed to work, when we all help each other out. When we stand together, we are stronger together.\n\nSo what I want you to know is if you join me in this campaign, I will always stand up and fight for you and fight for your jobs and fight for your families. And I guess we have about 36 days left. The election's going to be close. Every call you make, every door you knock, every friend you register to vote, could make the difference. You can text 'join,' j-o-i-n, to 47246 right now or go to hillaryclinton.com to sign up and volunteer. Here in Ohio you have until October the 11th to register to vote. And there are people with clipboards around, and you can go actually register today on your way out the door.\n\nSo we have just over a week to register, and then early voting starts October 12th. Let's prove - let's prove - that the American dream is big enough for everyone to share in its promise. Let's prove that we're going to stand together, make the smart decisions that we get the economy going and growing for everybody, not just those at the top; that we will stand up against special privilege and special interest; that we will be ready after this election to have an agenda that will really make a difference here in Toledo and across Ohio. So I'm here asking for your help, asking for your work, asking for you to be part of this campaign, and then when we win on November 8, be part of changing our country for the better! Thank you all and God bless you!\u0000","72":"Hello, Orlando! Wow. Thank you all so much. I am so happy to be back and I want to thank all of you for being here today at the Frontline Outreach Youth and Family Center, which does so much good work in the community. I want to acknowledge your terrific mayor, Mayor Buddy Dyer, who was here earlier. I want to thank Pastor Wynn, Tiffany Namey, the chair of the Orange County Disability Caucus, and everyone - especially Val Demings. Where's Val? Val - I know - got this crowd really whipped up, and I want you to stay whipped up for Val. She is going to be a great member of Congress for everything that we care about and are fighting for.\nI want to thank Anastasia for that introduction. Didn't she do an amazing job? I first met Anastasia when she was nine years old. She raised her hand at a town hall and she said, 'My twin sister can't speak. Because of that, they put her in a separate class, apart from the rest of the kids. But she can communicate with a computer. And she's very smart and would do just as well as anyone else, if the principal and teachers would just give her a chance.' I was just blown away by this nine-year-old girl - her confidence and how much she loved her sister.\n\nSo Anastasia and I have stayed in touch over the years. When she grew up, she became an intern in the Senate. I was so proud of her speech at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia too. And I'm very excited that she's here with us today.\n\nI also want to thank Orlando. It's great to be back in this wonderful city with all of you. You've been through a lot this year. And what has been so notable is you've responded with grace. You've shown the world what Orlando is made of - strength, love and kindness. This is something we could all use more of right now.\n\nI'm here today to talk about how to make our economy work for everyone, but first, I need to say something about two very upsetting incidents that took place over the past few days. First, an unarmed man named Terence Crutcher was shot and killed by a police officer in Tulsa. Then, a man named Keith Lamont Scott was shot and killed by a police officer in Charlotte. I'm sending condolences and prayers to their families; I know a lot of you are as well.\n\nThere is still much we don't know about what happened in both incidents. But we do know that we have two more names to add to a list of African Americans killed by police officers in these encounters. It's unbearable. And it needs to become intolerable.\n\nWe also saw the targeting of police officers in Philadelphia last week. And last night in Charlotte, 12 officers were injured in demonstrations following Keith Lamont Scott's death. Every day, police officers across our country are serving with extraordinary courage, honor and skill. We saw that again this weekend in New York and New Jersey and Minnesota. Our police handled those terrorist attacks exactly right. And they likely saved a lot of lives. I've spoken to many police chiefs and other law enforcement leaders who are as deeply concerned as I am and deeply committed, as I am, to reform. Why? Because they know it is essential for the safety of our communities and our officers. We are safer when communities respect the police and police respect communities.\n\nI've also been privileged to spend a lot of time with mothers who have lost children, and young people who feel that, as far as their country's concerned, their lives seem disposable. We've got to do better. And I know we can. And if I'm elected president, we will - and we will do it exactly together, which is the only way it can be done.\n\nLook, I know I don't have all the answers. I don't know anyone who does. But this is certain: too many people have lost their lives who shouldn't have.\n\nSybrina Fulton has become a friend of mine. Her son, Trayvon Martin, was killed not far from where we are today. Sybrina says, 'This is about saving our children.' And she's absolutely right. We need to come together, work together - white, black, Latino, Asian, all of us - to turn the tide, stop the violence, build the trust. We need to give all of our kids, no matter who they are, the chance to grow up safe and healthy in their communities and in our country.\n\nNow, there are so many issues we need to take on together, and that's why we're here today. Because in just 48 days - can you believe it, 48 days - Americans will go to the polls and choose our next president. Well, I hope so. I hope so. I want to just stress that our campaign is about the fundamental belief that, in America, every person, no matter what you look like, who you are, who you love, you should have the chance to go as far as your hard work and dreams will take you. And that is the basic bargain that made our country great, and it's our job to make sure it's there for you and future generations.\n\nBuilding an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top, is the central challenge of our time. And I take it personally, because I'm a proud product of the American middle class. My grandfather started working in a lace mill in Scranton, Pennsylvania, when he was just a boy, and worked there for 50 years. Thanks to him, my dad was able to go to college and then start his own small business, printing fabric for draperies. And because of my dad and my mom, I could head out into the world and follow my dreams.\n\nEvery American family should be able to write a similar story for themselves and their children. And history has shown us - our history has shown us that the strongest growth in our economy is inclusive, broad-based growth - when everyone can contribute to our prosperity and share in its rewards.\n\nNow, here is just one example. The flood of women into the American workforce over the past several decades was responsible for more than $3.5 trillion in economic growth. But as women's labor participation has slowed in recent years, due in part to our failure to provide family-friendly policies like paid leave and affordable childcare, so our economic growth wasn't as strong as it could have been. Women who want to work deserve to work. And whenever they are denied that opportunity, it's not fair to them - and we all lose out. In a competitive 21st century global economy, we cannot afford to leave talent on the sidelines. When we leave people out or write them off, we not only shortchange them and their dreams, we shortchange our country and our own futures.\n\nThat's one reason why I care so much about supporting working parents. It's one reason why I'm such a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform. Because bringing millions of undocumented workers into the formal economy will decrease abuse and exploitation, and it will increase our economic breath and our tax base. It is estimated if we did this, despite what you hear from the other side, we would increase our gross domestic product by an estimated $700 billion in 10 years. Now, we need that.\n\nIt's also one reason why we've got to break down barriers of systemic racism, including under-investment that has held communities of color back for generations. That's part of building an inclusive economy, too. And it's why I believe we need to do more to help young people, who are left behind in the wake of the Great Recession, find those strategies and opportunities that will get them moving ahead again. And we've got to help older Americans who've displaced by automation and outsourcing in our changing economy.\n\nAnd too often, training and retraining doesn't work as it should. If you don't have a four-year degree, if you haven't really had the chance to upgrade your skills over the years, it's hard to just make a course correction. We need to have apprenticeships and community college and technical programs, starting in high school and moving all the way up to older workers. Whether you're trying to start your career or you've spent decades contributing to our economy, you deserve better.\n\nNow, these are some of the elements of my plan for an inclusive economy, and I'm going to hold up the book Tim Kaine and I have put out because we've actually put in one place all of our plans. You see, we have this old-fashioned idea if we're asking you to support us, we should tell you what we're going to do. Right? And today I want to focus on one area that hasn't gotten enough attention. It concerns a group of Americans who are too often invisible, overlooked, and undervalued, who have so much to offer but are given too few chances to prove it. Now, that's been true for a long time, and we have to change it.\n\nI'm talking about people with disabilities, men and women, boys and girls, who have talents, skills, ideas, and dreams for themselves and their families just like anybody else. Whether they can participate in our economy and lead rich, full lives that are as healthy and productive as possible is a reflection on us as a country. And right now, in too many ways, we are falling short. We've got to face that and do better for everyone's sake because this really does go to the heart of who we are as Americans. I intend this to be a vital aspect of my presidency.\n\nI want to bring us together as a nation to recognize the humanity and support the potential of all of our people. And I want you to hear this because this is not well-known. Nearly one in five Americans lives with a disability. Now, some of those disabilities are highly visible, some much harder to notice. If you don't know you know someone with a disability, I promise you, you do. But their disability is just one part of who they are.\n\nAcross the country, people with disabilities are running businesses, teaching students, caring for our loved ones. They're holding public office, making breakthrough scientific discoveries, reporting the news, and creating art that inspires and challenges us. They're veterans whose service and sacrifice has protected our freedom and kept our country safe. They're working in the White House. Just last year a young woman named Leah Katz-Hernandez became the first West Wing receptionist who is deaf. So when world leaders come to the White House, the person who greets them is Leah. Think of the message that sends about how our nation sees the talent in everyone.\n\nAnd Americans with disabilities are working on presidential campaigns. I know because several of my staff and advisors have disabilities, and they're doing phenomenal work. I'm grateful to them every single day. And people all over America would say the same about their boss, their colleague, their employee, their family member with a disability.\n\nNow, over the past few days, our country has taken leaps forward, not just in recogniz-ing the humanity and dignity of people with disabilities, but in making long-overdue changes in our schools, workplaces, and communities so everyone can be part of our shared American life. Even so, not that long ago if you had a disability - if you couldn't see, couldn't walk, lived with dyslexia or muscular dystrophy or some other health issue - that one fact was allowed to define your entire life. Because of that and that alone, the world was closed to you. Not all of it and not for everyone, but for most people, basic essential things that others could do you couldn't and never would. And that was that.\n\nI saw this for myself, as Anastasia said, years ago when I was just starting out as a young lawyer working with the Children's Defense Fund. One of my first assignments was to figure out why so many American kids weren't in school. We looked at census tract numbers and we said, okay. How many young people between five and 18 live in this census tract? Then we would look at school enrollment numbers, and there'd be a gap. And we would say, wait a minute. Where are the kids? Why aren't they in school?\n\nI went door to door, along with people across our country, going into different communities. I was in New Bedford, Massachusetts. We saw a notable disparity there, and I soon realized that part of the problem was kids were stuck at home because of disabilities. There were kids who were hard of hearing, kids with intellectual disabilities. I remember one little girl in a wheelchair who was smart, curious, desperate to go to school. But that chair held her back. Not all schools had ramps or accessible bathrooms. Most teachers and aides weren't trained to help her. So she didn't get to go. It felt like the world had said to her, sorry, kid. Your life just isn't going to be worth very much. And she and her family weren't rich. They weren't powerful. So what could they do about it?\n\nThat little girl reminded me of another little girl, my mother. She didn't face the same challenges, but she, too, was clocked from a full and happy childhood - abandoned by her own parents, raised by grandparents who didn't want her, and ended up on her own when she was just 14, supporting herself as a housemaid. But then something finally went her way. The woman she worked for encouraged her to finish high school. And that family showed my mother what a happy family looked like. After many lonely years, it was the start of a better life.\n\nThe core lesson from her childhood was that none of us gets through life alone. We all have to look out for each other and lift each other up. And I remembered that, sitting with that little girl in a wheelchair. My colleagues and I at the Children's Defense Fund, along with others, gathered the facts, and we built a coalition of activists and families across America, and together we helped convince Congress to pass a groundbreaking law saying that children with disabilities have the same right to be educated in public school just like any other kids.\n\nSo we opened the doors to school, and then some years later I was so excited when the Americans with Disabilities Act finally passed, 26 years ago. It was bipartisan. The notion that workplaces and public spaces belong to everyone was something Democrats and Republicans both supported. And, by the way, I'm proud that some of the Democrats and Republicans who passed that landmark bill are supporting my campaign because they know where my heart is on this.\n\nAs Secretary of State, I appointed the first-ever special advisor for international disability rights because I wanted America to stand up for the rights and dignity of people with disabilities all over the world. And over the years, I've spent a lot of time working for kids with disabilities. In addition to Anastasia, who spoke at the convention, another young man, Ryan Moore, also spoke there. I first met Ryan when he was 7 years old. I was fighting for health care reform. He was born with a rare form of dwarfism. But he never let that stop him. He's had so many surgeries, we've lost count of them. But his family was always there for them and - for him. And he was the advocate for himself as he got older. Now he's a college graduate working in the technology department of his local school district. And he's just one of the most optimistic people you'll ever meet.\n\nListening to Ryan and Anastasia tell their stories at the convention this July made me think about all the people who never got the chance, never got the chance to get the education, let alone go to college, become forces for change. And I thought about all of the mothers and fathers across America who love their children more than anything and want so badly for them to have every opportunity that they deserve to have in America.\n\nI'll never forget something that the actor Christopher Reeve said. Some of you may be too young to know who he was. He was a huge star. He played Superman. He was unbelievably good-looking. He and his wonderful wife were friends of mine. And then he was paralyzed in a horse-riding accident. He once said that he had been thinking about a phrase that comes up a lot in our politics, 'family values.' 'Since my accident,' he said, 'I've found a definition that seems to make sense. I think it means that we're all family and we all have value.' I couldn't agree more.\n\nWe've come a long way since the fall of 1973, when I was going door to door talking to kids and families. But make no mistake. We still have a lot more work to do. We can't be satisfied, not when over 60 percent of adults with disabilities aren't in the workforce, not when businesses are allowed to pay employees with disabilities a subminimum wage , not when people with physical and intellectual disabilities are still subjected to stigma and discrimination every single day. We've got to build an inclusive economy that welcomes people with disabilities, values their work, treats them with respect.\n\nNow, one advocate after another has told me the same thing, 'We don't want pity. We want paychecks. We want the chance to contribute.' As president, I'm going to give - give them that chance. First, we're going to focus on jobs and incomes. I'm going to fight to give more Americans with disabilities the chance to work alongside those without disabilities and do the same jobs for the same pay and benefits. People with disabilities shouldn't be isolated. They should be given the chance to work with everyone else. And we're going to eliminate the subminimum wage, which is a vestige from an ugly, ignorant past. Good work deserves fair pay, no matter who you are.\n\nSecond, we're going to work with our colleges and universities to make them more accessible to students with disabilities. To have a truly inclusive economy, we need a truly inclusive education system. So let's raise our standards. For too long, accessibility has been an afterthought. Let's make it a priority in our curriculums, our classrooms, and the technology our students use. It's like what Anastasia said about her sister. She can communicate through a computer. Then let's make sure kids who can communicate that way have the opportunity to do so.\n\nThird, we're going to partner with businesses and other stakeholders to ensure those living with a disability can get hired and stay hired. As part of that, we'll launch a new effort we're calling Autism Works to help people with autism succeed in the workplace.\n\nFourth, let's build on the success of the Americans with Disabilities Act by finally ratifying the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. It has the strong backing of leaders across the political spectrum, and it's a chance to show American values and American leadership. And I have to tell you ever since I was first lady, I have had the great privilege of traveling the world on behalf of our country. When I was secretary of state, I went to 112 countries. And one of the things that I have noticed is how far behind many countries are in how they treat people with disabilities. Very often people with disabilities from the time they are babies and toddlers are locked away, basically forgotten. I want us since we have been the leader in this area to get that ratified and then to demonstrate to other countries what we have done and are doing to give dignity and opportunity to people with disabilities.\n\nNow, these ideas are just a start. We're working with advocates to come up with even more. If you've got an idea, we want to hear it. Go to hillaryclinton.com and leave your ideas because we are really welcoming this debate. This issue is very close to my heart.\n\nI've always believed that the ultimate test of our society is more than the size of our economy or the strength of our military. It's how we treat our fellow human beings, especially the most vulnerable among us. And on this front especially, I intend for my presidency to move our country forward. Together, we will make our economy and our country more welcoming to people with disabilities because we all win when everyone gets to share in the American dream.\n\nNow, if you want some proof, let me tell you this story. It's a story of a woman named Freia David. Now, some of you may have read about Freia in the Boston Globe. I've carried a copy of that article around with me because I loved it so much. Freia has Down syndrome. When she was 21, she got her first job, at the local McDonald's. Her mother was a little worried, as any mother would be. She wondered, would Freia be able to handle being independent? Could she handle the job? Would she even pass the six-month training program? Well, not everyone in her class passed, but Freia did. And then - then she excelled at that job for 32 years. Her colleagues loved her, and she loved them. The restaurant became such a home to her that she'd bring her family there on off days just to hang out.\n\nEarlier this year, Freia began to show signs of early-onset dementia. She knew that meant she had to stop working, but 32 years is a pretty good run, isn't it? It broke her heart. One thing that made it a little better is the whole staff threw a party in her honor. Her family hoped a few people might show up. And in the end, nearly 100 people did: customers, colleagues and friends from over the years. The party lasted three hours. And at one point, one of Freia's former managers asked for everyone's attention. She turned to Freia, and she said, 'We love you. We appreciate you. We respect you. And we are all better people for having you in our lives.'\n\nMy friends, after years of hard work and treating people right, isn't that what we all want to hear? Isn't that America at our best? We don't thrive on tearing each other apart, or separating ourselves. We know we are stronger together. We believe in equality and dignity for all. And when we fall short, we strive to do better, not to blame and scapegoat but to improve ourselves, to move toward becoming that more perfect union that our founders hoped for. This election is a chance for us to move still closer to that goal, to make sure everyone can contribute to a growing and prospering America, to say loudly and clearly in this country, no one's worthless, no one's 'less than.' We're all of value. In the United States of America, the greatest country in the world, we believe everyone is created equal. And you know what else we believe? We all believe love trumps hate.\n\nThank you all.\u0000","73":"Thank you. I am so thrilled to be back in Arizona.\nIn 35 days, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House.\n\nI am going to make America Rich again.\n\nI am going to end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, keep jobs from pouring out of our country, renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, and massively reduce taxes and regulations on our workers and our small businesses.\n\nMy economic agenda is very simple: jobs, jobs, jobs.\n\nI want to send our best wishes to the great governor Mike Pence, as he prepares for his debate tonight. The debate will be a contrast between our campaign of big ideas and bold solutions for tomorrow, versus the small and petty Clinton campaign that is stuck in the past. We are change - she is four more years of Obama.\n\nClinton can't talk about the real problems facing our country because she's the one who helped create all of our problems in the first place. To hide her corruption, she deleted 33,000 emails after a congressional subpoena.\n\nHillary Clinton has been there for 30 years, and hasn't fixed anything. In fact, she's just made things worse - she failed upstate New York, promising to create 200,000 jobs, but manufacturing is down almost 40 percent. She failed overseas, unleashing death and destruction. And she failed Latinos and African-Americans, producing only more poverty in the inner cities.\n\nNow, after years of failure, she complains about how I've used the tax laws to my benefit. Then why didn't she ever try to change those laws so I could not have used them the way I did? She could have changed those laws when she was in the Senate. The reason that she did not is that her donors and contributors have used those tax laws the same as I did.\n\nI know all their names, and I know who they are, but it's not up to me to make them public figures.\n\nTwo public Hillary supporters who are known are George Soros, who declared losses of $1.5 billion in just six months, and Warren Buffet who, in 2014, declared losses of $873 million.\n\nI know how the tax code works better than anyone, and I am going to fix it so it is fair, and just, and works for you and your family.\n\nI've made my money as a highly-successful private businessperson following the law. Hillary Clinton made her money as a corrupt public official violating the law and selling her government office.\n\nThe problems we face as a country are immense, and it is going to take bold action to turn things around.\n\nRight now, we owe $20 trillion in debt. It doubled under President Obama.\n\nOur infrastructure is like that of a third-world country.\n\nThe homicide rate last year experienced its largest single-year increase in 45 years.\n\nOur border is wide open, and drugs and criminal cartels our pouring into the country.\n\nThousands of refugees are being admitted, with no way to screen them, and are instantly made eligible for welfare and free healthcare - even as our own Veterans die waiting for the medical care they need.\n\nOur annual trade deficit with the world is nearly $800 billion a year.\n\nThe federal budget is a disaster. Our State Department, mostly under the watch of Hillary Clinton, misplaced or lost $6 billion in taxpayer funds.\n\nWe have the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.\n\nWe are nation divided, with race riots in the streets.\n\nOur college students graduate, loaded with debt, only to discover they can't find jobs - or certainly not the jobs they want.\n\nOverseas, our failed leaders have empowered Iran, unleashed ISIS, and turned Iraq, Libya and Syria into absolute chaos.\n\nOur allies aren't paying their fair share, foreign countries like Russia and China do not respect us, and our taxpaying citizens send troops and foreign aid all over the world even as their own cities can't provide the most basic services.\n\nAmerica needs a turnaround.\n\nAmerica needs a comeback.\n\nAmerica needs a change.\n\nThat is why I am running.\n\nFirst, we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare.\n\nThe architect of Obamacare, Jonathan Gruber, admitted that the whole sales pitch was a lie - he called it the \"stupidity of the American voter.\" But the only stupidity was the stupidity of our leaders who passed this disaster into law over the objections of the American people.\n\nDo you remember all the lies? President Obama said if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor.\n\nHe promised his plan would reduce premiums by $2,500 dollars. Instead, they surged $5,000.\n\nNow, of all people, President Bill Clinton has come out and told the truth about Obamacare.\n\nHe has absolutely trashed President Obama's signature legislation. Remember, Hillary Clinton called Obamacare \"one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, of the Democratic Party of our country.\"\n\nBill has a different view. Here is what bill said:\n\nHe just said it's a \"crazy system,\" where people end up with \"premiums doubled and coverage cut in half.\" He said \"it's the craziest thing in the world.\"\n\nBill Clinton said:\n\n\"people out there  busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week,  wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half - the people getting killed in this deal are the small business people and the individuals who make just a bit too much money to get any of these subsidies.\" Clinton added that it \"doesn't make any sense,\" and that \"the insurance model doesn't work.\"\n\nI couldn't agree more. Which is why, on my first day in office, I am going to ask a Republican Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace Obamacare.\n\nThis is essential for Arizona. Because of Obamacare, most of the state will only have 1 carrier next year, and premiums are expected to go up by 49% next year.\n\nThere is only 1 way to stop it: to vote for Trump. Early ballots are mailed out on October 12th, and you need to mail them back in as early as you possibly can.\n\nNext, we are going to unleash American energy\n\nI just met with energy producers in Colorado, and they are pleading with the government to let them create jobs and wealth in the United States.\n\nAs part our plan to reach 4% growth and create at least 25 million new jobs, we are going to lift the restrictions on shale, oil, natural gas, clean coal, and all forms of job-producing American energy.\n\nFixing our trade deals will be the foundation of our economic revival\n\nChina, Japan, and Europe are printing huge sums of money - the devaluation of currencies is staggering as to what it represents for our country, our businesses, and our citizens.\n\nWe're not on a level playing field, and our politicians don't understand what is going on.\n\nOur jobs are being lost in massive numbers, and we are not making things in America anymore. Too much is being made in other countries.\n\nWhen I am President, we will start making things in America again.\n\nCompanies like Apple, will start making their computers and iPhones in our country.\n\nOur nation has lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton's NAFTA - a deal supported by Hillary Clinton. Hillary's Korea deal also cost us another 100,000 jobs.\n\nSince China entered the World Trade Organization - another Bill and Hillary-backed deal - 70,000 factories have shut down or left the United States.\n\nThat's 15 factories closing a day, on average.\n\nNever in history has a country surrendered so much of its wealth to foreign countries.\n\nAs the factories leave, our money leaves with them. Stores close, schools suffer, the tax base erodes, wages fall and the quality of life declines.\n\nWe've rebuilt other countries at the expense of our own.\n\nCompanies like Carrier, General Electric, Motorola, Mattel, Fiat Chrysler, and so many others are moving their jobs to Mexico, and to other countries.\n\nAnd now, Ford has announced it's moving all of its small car production to Mexico also.\n\nWe are going to renegotiate NAFTA and if we don't get the deal we want, we will withdraw from NAFTA and start over to get a much better deal for our workers.\n\nWe are also going to stand up to foreign currency manipulation, and apply tariffs to countries that cheat.\n\nJobs will leave from other countries and come into the United States.\n\nFactories will come rushing in, our schools and communities will be revitalized, and our poorest citizens will get new jobs and higher pay -and new hope.\n\nBut to be a rich nation, we must also be a secure nation.\n\nSecurity begins at the border.\n\nA nation that doesn't control is borders is not a nation.\n\nA country that doesn't protect its people isn't a country.\n\nA government that doesn't put its own citizens first is a government unworthy and unfit to lead.\n\nHere are some heartbreaking examples of how our government has failed our citizens.\n\nCountless Americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this Administration. This includes incredible Americans like 21-year-old Sarah Root. The man who killed her arrived at the border, entered federal custody, and then was released into a U.S. community under the policies of this White House. He was released again after the crime, and is now at large.\n\nSarah had graduated from college with a 4.0, top of her class, the day before.\n\nAlso among the victims of the Obama-Clinton open borders policies was Grant Ronnebeck, a 21 year-old convenience store clerk in Mesa, Arizona. He was murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted of burglary who had also been released from Federal Custody.\n\nAnother victim is Kate Steinle, gunned down in the Sanctuary City of San Francisco by an illegal immigrant deported five previous times.\n\nThen there is the case of 90 year-old Earl Olander, who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death in his home. The perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records who did not meet the Obama Administration's priorities for removal.\n\nIn California, a 64-yeard old Air Force Veteran, Marilyn Pharis, was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer. Her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions, but was never deported.\n\nAlso in California, my good friend, Jamiel Shaw, lost his amazing son at the age of 17 - he was viciously shot and killed by an illegal immigrant with three gun charges, as well as battery of a police officer - but despite these previous crimes, he had not been deported.\n\nA 2011 report from the Government Accountability Office found that illegal immigrants and other non-citizens in our prisons and jails together had around 25,000 homicide arrests to their names.\n\nThere are more than 2 million criminal aliens in the county right now - when I am President, we are getting them out, and quickly.\n\nOn top of that, illegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion a year. For the money we are going to spend on illegal immigration over the next ten years, we could provide one million at-risk students with a school voucher.\n\nAt the same time, our country is being infiltrated by terrorists. Just yesterday, an immigrant from Bangladesh was charged in another ISIS plot. Hundreds of immigrants from high-risk regions have been implicated in terrorism inside the United States since 9\/11.\n\nThe terrorists who planted the bombs in New York and Jersey, and who carried out the mall stabbing in Minnesota, were foreign nationals admitted into our country - as was the mall shooter in Washington.\n\nOr look at cases like the Boston Bombers, here on asylum, or the San Bernardino Shooter, here on a fiance visa from Saudi Arabia. Or the Orlando shooter, the son of a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan.\n\nI am going to keep the terrorists out of our country.\n\nHillary Clinton wants a 550% increase in Syrian Refugees.\n\nHillary is for open borders.\n\nI am not running to be President of the world. I am running to be President of the United States. I am for America First.\n\nFor the first time in American history, we have the endorsement of our ICE officers and our Border Patrol officers.\n\nWe also have the endorsement of Sheriff Joe.\n\nWe are going to build a border wall, enforce our laws, and keep our people safe. The chaos, the violence and the crime will come to an end - beginning in January of 2017.\n\nWe are going to end the government corruption\n\nHillary Clinton put her emails on an illegal secret server open to foreign hacking. Then she bleached and destroyed 33,000 emails - after a congressional subpoena. She lied to Congress, under oath, and her staffers took the fifth amendment and got immunity deals. It's worse than Watergate.\n\nThe investigation of Hillary Clinton was rigged, and it's a shame, and it's one of the saddest things that have ever taken place in our nation.\n\nWe have become a Banana Republic.\n\nYesterday, we learned that the FBI made a side deal with Clinton's top aides to DESTROY their laptops.\n\nHillary Clinton is the ringleader of a criminal enterprise that has corrupted our government at the highest levels, and the American people have one chance to stop it - by sending in your ballots.\n\nWe are also going to fix our inner cities\n\n45% of African-American children under the age of six live in poverty.\n\n58% of African-American youth don't have jobs.\n\nMore than 3,000 have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.\n\nHomicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.\n\nThe Democrats, like Hillary Clinton, have run the inner cities for 50 years, six years, seventy years or more. They've produced only more joblessness, failing schools, and rising crime. They've horribly failed and abused our African-American and Latino communities.\n\nTo those African-Americans and Latinos suffering in our country I say: What do you have to lose? Vote For Donald Trump. I will fix it.\n\nTo everyone in the country I say: what do you have to lose?\n\nWe will have safe communities for EVERYONE.\n\nSchool choice for your children.\n\nGreat trade deals that bring jobs into our country, not out of our country.\n\nEveryone will be included in the American Dream.\n\nHere are the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:\n\nWe are going to have the biggest job-creating tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; end common core; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; make childcare affordable; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\n\nWe are going to rebuild America.\n\nWe are going to revitalize America.\n\nAnd we are going to unite America.\n\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\n\nYou're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this day. We're going to make history. This is a movement like you've never seen before. We're going to make history together.\n\nYou're going to look back at this event, and you're going to look back at November 8th, or the day you put in your early ballot, and say this is by far the most important vote I've ever cast for anyone at any time.\n\nYou are going to be proud of your country again, and you are going to be proud of your President again.\n\nA vote for me is a vote for change, and a vote for me is really a vote for you. You are voting to believe in yourselves. A vote for commonsense government, solutions to problems. It's a vote for jobs, jobs, jobs.\n\nIt's a vote for a government of, by and for the people.\n\nAll together, we are going to -\n\nMake America wealthy again.\n\nWe are going to make America strong again.\n\nWe are going to make America safe again.\n\nAnd we are going to make America great again.\u0000","74":"In 8 days, we are going to win the Great State of Michigan and we are going to win back the White House.\nLet me start today by making a very important promise. When we win on November 8th, I am going to bring back your jobs. The long nightmare of jobs leaving Michigan will be coming to an end. We will make Michigan the economic envy of the world once again.\n\nThe political class in Washington has betrayed you. They've uprooted your jobs, and your communities, and shipped your wealth all over the world. They put new skyscrapers up in Beijing while your factories in Michigan crumbled.\n\nI will end the theft of American prosperity. I will fight for every last Michigan job.\n\nBecause, when we win, it's going to be America First.\n\nSo you have to make sure you get in your absentee ballots, and to get to the polls on November 8th. You have to vote. Vote with all of your heart and soul. Show the whole world how much you love Michigan, and how much you love America, by voting to take back the jobs that have been stolen from you. I'm asking for the vote of Republicans, Democrats, Independents and First-Time voters who want great jobs, safe neighborhoods, and a government that works for the people.\n\nI'm asking you to believe in America once again.\n\nBut to bring back your jobs, we must also immediately repeal and replace Obamacare.\n\nIt's just been announced that Michigan residents are going to experience crushing double-digit premium hikes.\n\nIn Minnesota, where the premium increase will be close to 60 percent, the Democratic Governor has said \"the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable.\"\n\nHillary Clinton wants to double-down on Obamacare, making it even more expensive - in fact, much more expensive. I'm asking for your vote so we can replace Obamacare and save healthcare for every family in Michigan.\n\nReal change also means restoring honesty to our government.\n\nAs you know, the FBI has reopened its investigation into Hillary Clinton and has discovered another 650,000 emails. Hillary lied under oath when she said she turned over all of her work-related emails - just one more lie out of so many.\n\nThis is the biggest scandal since Watergate. Hillary wants to blame everyone else for her mounting legal troubles, but she has brought this all onto herself. Hillary is the one who set-up an illegal private email server in a closet to shield her criminal activity.\n\nHillary is the one who engaged in a corrupt Pay-For-Play scheme at the State Department - and now there are 5 FBI probes into the Clinton Foundation and their pay-for-play activities. Hillary is the one who sent and received classified information on an insecure server, putting the safety of the American people under threat.\n\nHillary is the one who lied to Congress under oath. Hillary is the one who lied to the FBI. Hillary is the one who made 13 phones disappear. Hillary is the one who destroyed 33,000 emails. Hillary is the one who broke the law over and over and over again. We can be sure that what is in those emails is absolutely devastating.\n\nHillary is not the victim - the American people are the victims of this corrupt system in every way, and this is your one chance to change it.\n\nHillary is likely to be under investigation for a very long time. One of her longtime supporters, a top Democratic Pollster, Doug Schoen, is now totally withdrawing his support. He wrote an article entitled \"I'm a Democrat, I worked for Bill Clinton, but I can't vote for Hillary.\"\n\nSchoen writes: \"I am now convinced that we will be facing the very real possibility of a constitutional crisis with many dimensions and deleterious consequences should Secretary Clinton win the election.\"\n\nSchoen warns that if Hillary is elected, she would be under protracted criminal investigation - and probably a trial of a sitting President.\n\nThe investigation will last for years, a trial will probably start, nothing will get done, and our country will continue to suffer.\n\nShe is unfit and unqualified to be President, and her election would mire our government and our country in a constitutional crisis we cannot afford. We need to be going to work for the American people - we can't do that with Hillary in the White House trying to avoid prosecution.\n\nHillary Clinton's corruption is a threat to Democracy, and the only way to save our Democracy is get out and vote by the millions.\n\nThe Clinton crime spree ends on November 8th. And when we close the chapter on the Clintons, we open a bright new chapter focused on the American People.\n\nMy Contract with The American Voter begins with a plan to restore honesty and accountability to our government.\n\nI want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and to heed the words we are all about to say. When we win on November 8th, We Are Going To Washington, D.C. And We Are Going to drain the swamp.\n\nAt the core of my contract is my plan to bring back your jobs.\n\nMichigan has lost more than 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton signed NAFTA, a deal strongly supported by Hillary Clinton.\n\nBefore NAFTA went into effect, there were 280,000 auto workers in Michigan. Today, that number is only 160,000. Our country has lost 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization - another Bill and Hillary-backed deal.\n\nWe have nearly an $800 billion annual trade deficit with the world. We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. Our trade deficit with China grew almost 40 percent during Hillary's tenure as Secretary of State. Her trade deal with South Korea killed another 100,000 America jobs.\n\nSo when you look around Michigan, and you see the rusted-out factories, the empty buildings, and the long unemployment lines, remember: Hillary Clinton did much of this to you.\n\nHillary got rich selling your jobs - the same special interests who pushed the jobs out of America are the people who've given countless millions to the Clintons. Hillary gets rich making America poor.\n\nJust look at the devastation. Delphi laid off 3,627 workers here in Michigan. Most of those jobs went to Mexico. We are going to fight for the workers at Delphi. They got a raw deal, and they deserve better.\n\nGM laid off 314 workers at the Lake Orion Assembly Plant in 2013 because of imports from the South Korean trade deal pushed through by Hillary Clinton.\n\nLear Corporation laid off another 50 people in Rochester Hills and moved their jobs to South Korea.\n\nFTE Automotive laid off 166 people in Auburn Hills. Their jobs went to Mexico.\n\nChrysler laid off over 5,300 workers. Those jobs went to Mexico, China, India and other countries.\n\nFord laid off 2,155 workers. Those jobs went to other countries.\n\nNow, Ford is moving all if its small car production to Mexico.\n\nA Trump Administration will stop the flight of American jobs.\n\nIf Ford, or another company, announces they want to move their jobs to Mexico or another country, then I will pick up the phone - I will call the executives - and I will tell them that if they want do that, we will charge a 35% tax when they try to ship their products back across the border.\n\nIt used to be the cars were made in Flint and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico. Now, the cars are made in Mexico and you can't drink the water in Flint.\n\nWe are going to turn it all around. We are going to rebuild Flint. We are going to rebuild Detroit. And we are going to rebuild Michigan.\n\nI'd like to share a special message today with the African-American community in Michigan which has been so terribly harmed by the policies of the Clintons.\n\nLook at the City of Detroit. It used to be the manufacturing hub of the world - now, nearly half of Detroit residents do not work, it has the second-highest violent crime rate in the country, and the children are trapped in failing government schools.\n\nYet, as the people of Detroit suffer, Hillary wants to spend trillions of dollars on government benefits for illegal immigrants and refugees.\n\nI've outlined a plan for urban renewal, it's called A New Deal For Black America. That deal includes a plan to use the money we will save by securing our border, and curbing refugee admissions, to invest in communities like Flint and Detroit.\n\nIt includes a pledge of school choice for African-American children.\n\nMy plan also includes a promise to cancel billions in climate change spending for the United Nations - a number Hillary wants to increase - and instead use that money to provide for American infrastructure, including clean water in cities like Flint.\n\nMy plan also includes a pledge to reduce violent crime - every child in this nation has a right to grow up in safety and peace. And my plan includes a pledge to restore manufacturing in the United States.\n\nHillary and the Democratic Party have run the inner cities for years, and only produced more poverty. The time has come for real change - I'm asking you for the honor of your vote so that together we can turn decades of political failure into generations of lasting success.\n\nHillary, on the other hand, wants to destroy what's left of manufacturing in Michigan with the Trans-Pacific Partnership. A Trump Administration will stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n\nWe will renegotiate NAFTA and, if we don't get the deal we want, we will terminate NAFTA and get a much better deal. We are going to lower taxes on American business from 35 percent to 15 percent. We are going to massively cut taxes for the Middle Class.\n\nWe will unleash American energy - including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal. The Obama-Clinton war on coal is going to cost this state 50,000 jobs.\n\nWe will also work to restore and protect the Great Lakes. We are going to become a rich country again. But to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country.\n\nHillary Clinton wants a 550% increase in Syrian Refugees. Hillary's immigration plans mean generations of terrorism, extremism and radicalism spreading into your schools and communities here in Michigan.\n\nWhen we win, we will suspend the Syrian Refugee Program - and we will keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country.\n\nA Trump Administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. And yes, we will build a wall.\n\nWe've received the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers. They tell us the border crisis is the worst it's ever been - it's a national emergency. They also warn America that Hillary's plan is the \"the most radical proposal in U.S. history.\"\n\nWhen I become President, we will end illegal immigration, deport all criminal aliens, and put American Workers First.\n\nWe will also repeal the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military.\n\nWe also need a new foreign policy that puts America First.\n\nHillary led us to disaster in Iraq, Syria and Libya. Then, after Benghazi, she looked the families of the fallen in the eye and lied - she blamed it all on a video.\n\nHillary and our failed Washington Establishment have spent $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East, and now it's in worse shape than ever before. Imagine if some of that money had been spent building new schools, roads and bridges right here in Michigan.\n\nNow, Hillary - trapped in her Washington bubble that is blind to the lessons of the past - wants to start a shooting war in Syria in conflict with a nuclear-armed Russia, that could drag us into World War III.\n\nThe arrogant political class never learns. They keep repeating the same mistakes, they keep telling the same lies, they keep producing the same failed results.\n\nHow can Hillary manage this country when she can't even manage her email server? It's just one disaster after another, one scandal after another, one betrayal after another.\n\nTo all Americans I say: it is time for new leadership.\n\nJust think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days -\n\nWe are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation; cancel every illegal Obama executive order; rebuild our military and take care of our Vets; support the men and women of law enforcement; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\n\nHillary wants us to think small, wants us to believe things can't change, and wants our lives to revolve around Washington, D.C. I am asking you to dream big, to push for bold change, and to believe in a movement powered by the people and by their love for this country.\n\nI'm tired of politicians telling Americans to defer their dreams to another day - when they really mean another decade.\n\nAmerica is tired of waiting. The moment is now.\n\nAll we have to do is stop believing in our failed politicians and start believing in each other and in our country.\n\nThere is no challenge too great, no dream outside of our reach. Don't let anyone tell you it can't be done -- the future lies with the dreamers, not the cynics and the critics.\n\nHillary has been there for 30 years, and she has accomplished nothing - she's just made things worse. She is the candidate of yesterday. We are the movement of the future.\n\nOur movement represents all Americans, from all backgrounds, and all walks of life. We are asking for the votes of Republicans, Democrats, Independents, and first-time voters.\n\nWe are asking for the vote of every American who believes truth and justice - not money and power - should rule the day.\n\nWe are fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people - not the donors and special interests.\n\nWe are fighting to unlock the potential of every American community, and every American family, who hope and pray and yearn for a better future.\n\nWith your vote, we are just 8 days away from the change you've been waiting for your entire life.\n\nTogether, We Will Make America Wealthy Again.\n\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\n\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\n\nAnd We Will Make America Great Again.\u0000","75":"Thank you.\nIn 24 days, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House.\n\nWe are going to deliver real change that puts America First.\n\nWe are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals, reduce surging crime, cut taxes and regulations, lift the restrictions on American energy, end common core, reduce the cost of college, make childcare more affordable, and repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.\n\nYour jobs will come back under a Trump Administration. Your incomes will go up under a Trump Administration. Your taxes will go way down under a Trump Administration. Your companies won't be leaving our country under a Trump Administration.\n\nWe are going to be a rich country again.\n\nWe are also going to end government corruption. Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the Presidency - and the media, donors and special interests who support her will do everything they can to cling to their power and prestige at your expense.\n\nThe Hillary Clinton documents released by WikiLeaks make more clear than ever just how much is at stake in this election.\n\nThe documents show the Clinton Campaign colluding with the State Department and Justice Department over the investigation into Hillary's illegal email server that put your family and your country in danger.\n\nThey show how the Clintons ripped off the people of Haiti.\n\nThey show the Clinton Campaign viciously attacking Catholics and Evangelicals.\n\nThey also show how the media collaborates and conspires directly with the Clinton Campaign.\n\nTo cover-up her crimes, Hillary Clinton deleted 33,000 emails - after a Congressional Subpoena - she lied to Congress under oath, she made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer, and now we learn 2 boxes of evidence mysteriously went missing.\n\nHillary Clinton should have been prosecuted, and gone to jail for her crimes. The FBI and the Department of Justice created a fraud in allowing Hillary Clinton to get away with her terrible crimes - and I guarantee you, the Clintons are laughing at them. The Director's performance in Congress, coupled with Bill Clinton's clandestine meeting on the tarmac in the Attorney General's airplane just prior to decision-time on Hillary - supposedly talking about golf and grandchildren - is perhaps the lowest point in those department's history.\n\nInstead of being held accountable, Hillary is running for President in what looks like a rigged election. The election is being rigged by corrupt media, pushing completely false allegations and outright lies, in an effort to elect her President.\n\nBut we are going to stop it. We are not going to back down. We are not going to let it happen. We are just getting started.\n\nAmericans have had it with the years, the decades, of Clinton Corruption. They get rich stealing your jobs and shipping them to other countries.\n\nThis will finally be the year the American people say: Enough is Enough.\n\nSpeaking in secret to a foreign bank Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally \"open trade and open borders.\"\n\nBy \"open trade,\" she means foreign countries can cheat us out of millions of jobs and trillions of dollars.\n\nBy \"open borders,\" she means totally unlimited immigration.\n\nWhen she thought no one was listening, Hillary Clinton was plotting to destroy the sovereignty of the United States.\n\nEither we win the election, or we lose the country.\n\nA Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders. And yes, we will build a wall.\n\nA wall will not only keep out dangerous cartels and criminals, but it will also keep out the drugs and heroin poisoning our youth.\n\nWhen I won the New Hampshire primary, I promised the people of New Hampshire that I would stop drugs from pouring into your communities. I am now doubling-down on that promise, and can guarantee you - we will not only stop the drugs from pouring in, but we will help all of those people so seriously addicted get the assistance they need to unchain themselves.\n\nNew Hampshire has one of the highest drug overdose death rates in the country.\n\nWe have to solve this crisis.\n\nI have to give credit to my running mate, Mike Pence, on this issue.\n\nMike increased the mandatory minimum sentences for the most serious drug offenders, while expanding access to treatment and prevention options for those struggling with addiction.\n\nWe must make similar efforts a priority for the nation.\n\nNot too long ago we read about Christopher Honor and Courtney Griffin -- a young Rockingham County couple who died of an overdose within a year of each other. Their story of prescription drugs, heroin, wait times for treatment, and missed opportunity in the court system are a tragic reminder of why we need a plan to end the opioid epidemic.\n\nFirst, we will stop the flow of illegal drugs into the country.\n\nThe number of heroin seizures on the border has tripled since 2008.\n\nI've received the first-ever endorsement of our Border Patrol and ICE officers, and under a Trump Administration, we will work with them to end the flow of drugs across our border for good.\n\nWe are also going to put an end to Sanctuary Cities, which refuse to turn over illegal immigrant drug traffickers for deportation.\n\nWe will dismantle the illegal immigrant cartels and violent gangs, and we will send them swiftly out of our country.\n\nWe will aggressively prosecute traffickers of illegal drugs, and provide law enforcement and prosecutors with the resources and support they need to do their jobs.\n\nPresident Obama has commuted the sentences of record numbers of high level drug traffickers, many of them kingpins, and violent armed traffickers with extensive criminal histories. Hillary Clinton promises to continue and expand this approach, turning our streets back over to gangs, drug cartels, and armed career criminals.\n\nOver the last few years this administration has been steadily dismantling the federal criminal justice system. Tens of thousands of drug dealers have been released from prison early, including many illegal immigrants--regardless of their history of violence, or ties to transnational gangs and cartels.\n\nSecond, we will close the shipping loopholes that China and others are exploiting to send dangerous drugs across our borders in the hands of our own postal service.\n\nThese traffickers use loopholes in the Postal Service to mail fentanyl and other drugs to users and dealers in the U.S.\n\nA Trump administration will crack down on this abuse, and give law enforcement the tools they need to accomplish this mission.\n\nThird, we will fix the misguided rules and regulations that have made this problem worse.\n\nIt is tragedy enough that so many Americans are struggling with life-threatening addiction. We should not compound that tragedy with government policies and bureaucratic rules that make it even harder for them to get help.\n\nThe FDA has been far too slow to approve abuse-deterring drugs. And when the FDA has approved these medications, the rules have been far too restrictive, severely limiting the number of authorized prescribers as well as the number of patients each doctor can treat.\n\nRecovery medications have the potential to save thousands and thousands of lives. We prescribe opioids like Oxycontin freely, but when patients become addicted to those drugs, we stop doctors from giving patients the treatments they medically need.\n\nAs president, I'd work to lift the cap on the number of patients that doctors can treat, provided they follow safe prescribing practices and proper treatment supervision.\n\nAt the same time, DEA should reduce the amount of Schedule II opioids (drugs like oxycodone, methadone and fentanyl) that can be made and sold in the U.S. We have 5 percent of the world's population, but use 80 percent of the prescription opioids.\n\nFinally, we will give people struggling with addiction access to the help they need.\n\nCongress has already taken the first step by passing the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. This legislation is an important step.\n\nI would also expand incentives for states and local governments to use drug courts and mandated treatment. These can be a cost effective, appropriate, and humane response to addiction.\n\nI would dramatically expand access to treatment slots and end Medicaid policies that obstruct inpatient treatment.\n\nI would dramatically expand first responders' and caregivers' access to Narcan, an antidote that treats overdoses and saves thousands of lives.\n\nI would also restore accountability to our Veterans Administration. Too many of our brave veterans have been prescribed these dangerous and addictive drugs by a VA that should have been paying them better attention.\n\nTogether, these steps will ensure that every American struggling with addiction has access to the care and the help that he or she needs.\n\nBut, if we are going to bring hope back to our communities, we not only have to solve our drug crisis but our economic crisis.\n\nThe wealth has been raided from our country, leaving behind dilapidated communities, rusted out factories, and shattered dreams.\n\nAt the center of our economic revival will be fixing our terrible trade deals.\n\n47 million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are on Food Stamps.\n\nWe have nearly an $800 billion annual trade deficit in goods with the world, and the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.\n\nThis is the legacy of Obama-Clinton.\n\nThe state of New Hampshire has lost nearly 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton.\n\nSince China entered the World Trade Organization - another Bill and Hillary-backed deal - 70,000 factories have shut down or left the United States.\n\nThat's 15 factories closing a day, on average.\n\nWe are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.\n\nCompanies like Carrier, General Electric, Motorola, Mattel, Fiat\n\nChrysler, and so many others are moving their jobs to Mexico.\n\nRight here in New Hampshire, I visited the Osram Sylvania plant that closed its doors in 2014 and shipped its jobs to China and Mexico.\n\nIf I win, day one, we are going to announce our plans to renegotiate NAFTA. If we don't get the deal we want, we'll leave NAFTA and start over to get a much better deal.\n\nWe are going to start making things in America again.\n\nAs part of our plan to bring back our jobs, we are going to lower our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent.\n\nWe will have a 10% tax on money parked overseas, bringing trillions in wealth back into our country.\n\nManufacturers will be able to expense the cost of new investment and equipment, to help make our country more competitive.\n\nWe will lower taxes massively on all Americans - Hillary will raise your taxes massively.\n\nWe will become the great jobs magnet of the world.\n\nWages will rise, jobs will return, and factories will come rushing onto our shores.\n\nHere are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:\n\nWe are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; defend religious liberty; reduce the cost of tuition; rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; repeal and replace Obamacare; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\n\nYou have 24 days to make every dream you ever dreamed of for your country come true.\n\nOn November 8th, the arrogance of Washington D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.\n\nI am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation - and I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.\n\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\n\nYou're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this day. This is a movement like you've never seen before. We're going to make history together. You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote I've ever cast for anyone at any time.\n\nOnce again, we are going to have a government of, by and for the people.\n\nWe will make America wealthy again.\n\nWe will make America strong again.\n\nWe will make America safe again.\n\nAnd we are going to make America great again.\u0000","76":"Thank you. It is always so great to be back in New Hampshire, the state where we had our first victory in this incredible journey.\nI've come to know and love the people of New Hampshire. You are strong, independent and you are free.\n\nWe are all going to work very hard together over the next 40 days, and we are going to win this state, we are going to win the White House.\n\nWe are going to take on the special interests, the lobbyists, and the corrupt corporate media that have rigged the system against everyday Americans.\n\nWe are going to create millions of new jobs for our people, trillions in new wealth for our communities, and rising wages for every working American.\n\nWe are going to create a new government that serves you, your family, and your country.\n\nWe are going to end the Clinton Corruption and restore dignity and honesty to government service.\n\nHillary Clinton is an insider fighting only for herself and for her donors.\n\nI am an outsider fighting for you.\n\nEverything you need to know about Hillary Clinton can be understood with this simple but very important phrase: Follow The Money.\n\nThe large corporations who support terrible trade deals that offshore jobs - they are donating to Hillary Clinton.\n\nFollow the money.\n\nThe Wall Street investors who have rigged the regulations against the middle class - they are donating to Hillary Clinton.\n\nFollow the money.\n\nThe wealthy donors who want to shut down American energy - they are donating to Hillary Clinton.\n\nFollow the money.\n\nThe special interests who want open borders are donating to Hillary Clinton.\n\nAgain, just follow the money.\n\nIn her campaign for President, Hillary Clinton has received $100 million dollars in contributions from Wall Street and the hedge funds.\n\nShe and Bill were paid $150 million for speeches since Bill left the Oval Office.\n\nThe same groups paying Bill and Hillary for their speeches were lobbying the federal government.\n\nTwenty-two groups paying Bill Clinton for speeches lobbied the State Department while Hillary was Secretary of State.\n\nFavors and access were granted to those who wrote checks.\n\nShe put the office of Secretary of State up for sale - and if she ever got the chance, she'd put the Oval Office up for sale too.\n\nShe deleted and bleached 33,000 emails after a Congressional subpoena. 13 phones missing, several destroyed with a hammer. Her staffers taking the fifth amendment, and her ringleaders getting immunity deals. We're going to call them the FBI Immunity 5. Foreign enemies with easy access to hack her server. Lies to Congress, under oath, about turning over her work-related emails.\n\nShe and her financial backers will say anything, do anything, lie about anything to keep their grip on power - to keep their control over this country.\n\nThe American people have had it with years, decades, of Clinton Corruption and scandals. They are tired of the lies, they are tired of the trivial politics, they are tired of being talked down to, looked down upon, and treated like second class citizens.\n\nThe Clintons are the sordid past.\n\nWe are the bright future.\n\nWhile our campaign outlines big changes and bold solutions to make your life better, the Clinton campaign focuses only on small and petty distractions.\n\nThis will be the year the American people say: Enough is enough.\n\nHillary Clinton has been a disaster for so many communities, but especially for African-American communities. I don't think African-Americans are going to come out and vote for Clinton - they are too smart, and they know they are being used. They also know that she'll do nothing for them once the election is over - she never does, and that will never change. Many of them will never forget her calling young African-American men \"super-predators.\"\n\nSame thing goes for Hispanic voters - they are tired of being used by people like Hillary Clinton, that have no intention of doing anything for them once the election is over.\n\nA Trump Administration will bring prosperity to all of our people.\n\nMy economic agenda can be summed up with three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs.\n\nWe are going to pass the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan, and we are going to lower the business rate from 35% to 15% -- making America into a magnet for new jobs.\n\nEvery wasteful and unnecessary regulation will be eliminated, along with every illegal executive order.\n\nWe will unleash the power of American energy - we are sitting on $50 trillion dollars in untapped energy reserves, and we are going to put that wealth into the pockets of the American people.\n\nCommon core will be ended, and disadvantaged children will be allowed to attend the school of their choice.\n\nThe catastrophe known as Obamacare will be repealed and replaced.\n\nAnd the disastrous trade deals, like NAFTA, that have caused so much pain in New Hampshire, will be renegotiated.\n\nNAFTA was signed by Bill Clinton, and supported by Hillary Clinton - and your state has lost 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since it was approved. You've lost 1 in 4 since China entered the World Trade Organization - another Bill and Hillary-backed deal.\n\nHillary Clinton has been on the wrong side of every major trade deal in her career and, if she gets the chance, she would approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership - which would destroy manufacturing in this state.\n\nHillary Clinton is merely a vessel for the special interests trying to strip this country of its wealth, its jobs, and its status as a sovereign nation. She is a globalist who has made a career taking jobs from our country and giving them to other countries.\n\nI am not running to be President of the World. I am running to be President of the United States of America.\n\nFrom now on, it's going to be America First.\n\nHave you ever wondered why it is that all things that the American people want never seem to happen?\n\nThink about it. For how many years have the American people asked for our tax code to be fixed? Or for our infrastructure to be repaired? Or for the waste to be removed from the budget? For how many years have voters pleaded for secure borders, fair trade deals, and quality schools that serve parents and students?\n\nAll the things you've ever wanted for your country have been denied.\n\nThe reason for this is simple. It's because the financial interests who control our politics and our media don't want these changes to happen.\n\nThese special interests control Hillary Clinton. She is their chosen representative.\n\nShe's been there for 30 years, and has never done anything for you and your family.\n\nShe's there for only one reason, to protect her donors and collect their money.\n\nOur campaign is taking on big business, big media and big donors - we're taking them on for YOU. So you can have the future you want.\n\nThat includes keeping your family safe.\n\nNew FBI statistics shows that homicide rose 15% last year in America's large cities, and that it's the largest single-year increase in 45 years.\n\nMore than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since January.\n\nThe failed politicians and the arrogant media don't want me to talk about the crime and the violence that is happening in our country. They just want me to go along with the status quo.\n\nWell, I have news for the people trying to silence me, and trying to silence all of us.\n\nWe will never back down from fighting to save American lives.\n\nThat also means keeping our nation safe from Radical Islamic Terrorism. Hillary Clinton can't even say the words.\n\nWe are also going to keep our country safe from drugs. New Hampshire has suffered so greatly from the heroin crisis and the drugs pouring across our border. The rate of heroin overdoses has nearly quadrupled - once again, our politicians have tragically failed this country and its people.\n\nI am going to stop the drugs from pouring across our border - that is a promise.\n\nThe people getting rich off the rigged system are the people throwing their money at Hillary Clinton.\n\nOur campaign is about breaking-up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We're trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives.\n\nThey're all part of the same corrupt political establishment. And they nod along when Hillary Clinton slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable.\n\nI call you hardworking American Patriots and together we are going to save this country.\n\nTogether, we can accomplish anything we want.\n\nBut that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th.\n\nYou have to knock on doors. You have to pick up that phone. You have to campaign on the streets. Spread the love that we have in this room to the people of our country. To beat the system, you have to lift your voice, pound the pavement, and get out the vote. Visit our website to find out how you can help.\n\nYou have 40 days until the election. You have 40 days to make every dream you ever dreamed for your country come true.\n\nDo Not Let This Chance Slip Away.\n\nYou have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this nation.\n\nThe arrogance of Washington, D.C. will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.\n\nOn November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is Back - Bigger and Better and Stronger than ever before.\n\nHere is just some of the great things that will happen for your country:\n\nWe are going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; make childcare more affordable; bring back our manufacturing jobs; keep Radical Islamic terrorists out of our country; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\n\nWe will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.\n\nAmerican cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.\n\nAmerican steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.\n\nAmerican hands will rebuild this nation - and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.\n\nWe will put new American steel into the spine of this country.\n\nI will fight for every neglected part of this nation - and I will fight to bring us all together as Americans.\n\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\n\nIt is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.\n\nOnce more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.\n\nWe Will Make America Wealthy Again.\n\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\n\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\n\nAnd We Will Make America Great Again.\n\nThank you, and God Bless!\u0000","77":"Wow, tremendous. Wow. Thank you very much. Thank you. Unbelievable. People don't know, I worked in Ohio, did you know that? \nAnd I had a great experience. \n\nAnd if I didn't have a great experience starting out when I was very young, maybe I wouldn't be here right now, who knows? You need that, it was great for confidence also. In 12 days, we're going to win Ohio \n\nAnd we are going to win back the White House. \n\nA brand new poll from Remington Research highly respected has just a few minutes ago come out, and in Ohio we are right now, four points up. \n\nEarly voting is underway, so make sure, get out and vote, we don't wanna we don't wanna give this away.\n\n No!\n\nYou know, we have a movement going on like they've never seen before in this country. Drain the swamps, you've gotta a \"drain the swamp\" sign back there, we're going to drain the swamp, believe me. \n\nBut this is a movement like they've never seen in this country before, and every place is packed, and the greatest people on Earth, and we're going to turn our country around, we're going to turn it around fast. \n\nSeventy-five percent of the people think our country is headed in the wrong direction. We know it's headed in the wrong direction. We're going to fix it, we're going to take our country back, and it's going to be put very quickly on the right track. \n\nReal change begins with immediately repealing and replacing Obamacare. \n\nIt's just been announced that Americans are going to experience another massive double-digit hike in Obamacare, you see that. \n\nIncluding premiums like in the great state of Arizona, where they're going to go up at 116 percent. Don't worry, you'll be there very soon, unless I win in which case you're not going to have to worry about it. \n\nEven Bill Clinton admitted that Obamacare is quote, \"The craziest thing in the world, where people wind up paying their premiums which double, and their coverage is cut in half.\"\n\nJob killing \n\nJob killing Obamacare is just one more way the system is rigged. Remember the name Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare? \n\nHe said they could pass Obamacare when he didn't know he was being recorded he said they could pass Obamacare, because the stupidity of the American voter will allow it to take place. \n\nThe only stupidity was that incredible stupidity shown by our politicians when they forced this bill through over the furious objection to many politicians, in all fairness, many, many politicians, but really the American people. And it was very, very sad. And in all fairness to the Democrats, had our President not lied 28 times remember, you can keep your plan, you can keep your doctor, it passed by this much they would not have gone for it. But they believed him too, like everybody else believed him.\n\nThey've caught them in a lot of lies lately, folks. Hillary Clinton, talking about liars, wants to double down \n\nHillary Clinton wants to double down on Obamacare and make it even worse. So, here, I'm going to repeal it, replace it. We're going to have a replacement that is so much less expensive and so much better. You don't even get to use Obamacare because the deductible is so high and, you know, it's just Look, it is so it is so out of control, you'll never get to use it. Four or five thousand dollars before you can start taking Just this and just happened, Hillary Clinton declared that Obamacare do you remember this not so long ago as one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, of the Democratic Party, and of our county. It's a total disaster. \n\nHere in Ohio, another five insurance companies are dropping out of Obamacare. Good luck, good luck in negotiations, folks. That means that all the residents covered by plans from these companies will be getting cancellation notices very soon. Obamacare is really and you know this a catastrophe it's a catastrophic event for Ohio workers and is making it impossible for many parents to pay their bills, support their families, or get quality medical care to their children. Repealing Obamacare is one of the single most important reasons we must win on November eighth. \n\nHave to win. Real change also means getting rid of the corruption in Washington, D.C. \n\nHillary Clinton bleached and deleted 33,000 e-mails, lied to Congress under oath, made 13 phone calls, I mean 13, 13 phones, made them disappear, sometimes with a hammer. Right? Wrong, wrong. Let's get rid of these And then told the FBI she could remember 39 different times.\n\nThe Clinton crew gave more than $675,000 to the wife of the Deputy Director of the FBI, and the man who was overseeing the investigation into Hillary's illegal server, a server we now know Obama knew about. Just found that out yesterday. WikiLeaks. The more e-mails WikiLeaks releases, the more lies between the Clinton Foundation, the Secretary of State's office, and the Clintons' personal finances, they all get blurred.\n\nJust today we read about Clinton confidante Doug Brand, bragging that he had funneled tens of millions of dollars to Bill Clinton, Inc., through the Foundation donations, paid speeches, and consulting contracts. Mr. Band called the arrangement unorthodox. The rest of us call it outright corrupt. In fact, the Clinton Foundation even hired a law firm to find out if their pay to play scheme would jeopardize their charitable status with the IRS.\n\nIf the Clintons were willing to play this fast and loose with their enterprise when they weren't in the White House, just imagine what they'll do given the change to once again control the Oval Office. And we've had enough. Honestly, I think we've had enough of the Clintons, in all fairness. Right? Don't you agree? \n\nHad enough. I mean at what point, at what point do we say it? Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the presidency. \n\nI propose a contract with the American voter that will end the corruption and give the government back to the people. I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and to heed the words I'm about to say. If we win on November eighth, when \n\nOK, OK. When we win on November eighth. \n\nWe don't want to take it for granted, but we are winning in a lot of states, I have to say. The media now, they're going wild. The media's going wild. Because they're saying, you know, this guy's winning in Florida, he's winning in North Carolina, he's winning in Iowa, he's winning in Ohio. All right. When we win, right, we are going to Washington, D.C., and we are going to drain the swamp. \n\nA lot of spirit in this room it's a good one. That includes a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress. At the core of my contract is my economic plan. That plan can be summarized in three very beautiful words, especially for the people in this area and this room jobs, jobs, jobs.\n\nNo, it's terrible what's happened, what's happened in this area, what's happened in this country with jobs is terrible. Hillary Clinton promised to bring upstate New York 200,000 jobs when she ran for Senate. Instead the jobs left. They didn't come in, they left. She been there for 30 years and hasn't fixed anything. She's just made things worse, except for herself and her husband.\n\nForty-seven million Americans are on food stamps, and 45 million Americans live in poverty. Nearly one in four Americans, in their prime earning years, are not working or able to work. Seventy million American women and children are in poverty or on the brink of poverty, and nearly half of African-American children under the age of six are living in abject poverty\n\nOur national debt has doubled in eight years, and our infrastructure throughout our country is crumbling, bad shape. Our airports, our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our schools, our hospitals. Our trade deficit with the world is now nearly $800 billion a year. We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. Think of it. And that's so true. The single greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.\n\nWhat our politicians have allowed to happen to this area, but to all areas of our country. NAFTA, TPP they want to approve. A disaster. Ohio has lost one in four manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported strongly by Hillary Clinton. Remember, every time you see a closed factory, a wiped out community in Ohio, it was essentially caused by the Clintons. It was NAFTA. It was caused by the Clintons. Why a deal like that was allowed.\n\nWe've lost 70,000 factories. Think of that one, 70. I tell everybody, it's a typo. Can't be 70,000. It is. We've lost 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization, another Bill and Hillary-backed disaster. Just this year, Eaton Corporation in Ohio closed its plant, laid off 152 workers, and moved their jobs to Mexico. And you've had many. I could I could name them all day long.\n\nUnder my contract, if a company wants to fire their workers, move to Mexico or other countries, and ship their products back into the United States, we will put a 35 percent tariff on those products. \n\nAnd folks, just in case you have any questions, when that happens you're not losing your companies anymore. And if you do, at least the country's gonna make a lot of money. OK? We will immediately begin renegotiating NAFTA, and if we don't get the deal we want - right now it's a one-way highway. We lose our jobs, we lose our companies, we lose everything. We lose our cash. They get the cash, they get the jobs, they get the companies. We get the drugs, we get the unemployment. That's what we get. We get nothing. We get less than nothing.\n\nWe will terminate NAFTA and get a much better deal for our workers if we can't renegotiate it properly. We're gonna get a better deal for our workers and for our companies. Because we cannot continue to be the people led by stupid people. We can't. We can't. \n\nAs part of our plan to bring back American jobs we will lower taxes on our businesses from 35 percent down to 15 percent. We will also cut taxes for middle class families by 35 percent and massively simplify taxes for all Americans. We will be a rich nation once again. \n\nBut to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country. Hillary Clinton unleashed ISIS onto the world, you know that story. And spreading violently, it's spreading now into the United States. There are now 1,000 open ISIS investigations in the United States. ISIS is on a campaign of genocide against Christians in the Middle East, or what they call the Nation of the Cross. OK. The Nation of the Cross.\n\nThey are crucifying, drowning and beheading their victims. This is something that we would read about in history books. And not since medieval times, right? Have you heard the beheadings and all the things that are happening. So we have no choice. We will stop ISIS and we still stop them fast. \n\nAnd unlike what they've done in Mosul, which is turning out to be very difficult, we're not giving three and four months notice. We're coming in. We're coming in. You think General George Patton would say, \"We're coming in in three or four months, get ready\"? What a bunch. They're throwing people off buildings, hanging their victims from meat hooks. They're hanging their victims from meat hooks. The New York Post just published reports about ISIS crushing children to death and burning adults alive.\n\nNow Hillary wants massive immigration from the most dangerous regions of the world, where ISIS operates, including a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees over and above the thousands and thousands that President Obama is taking. \n\nWe don't want ISIS in our country. The Hillary refugee plan would leave us with generations of terrorism, radicalism and extremism inside of our shores. I only want to admit people who will support this country and love its people. SO important. \n\nKeeping our families safe is the highest obligation of the president of the United States. A Trump administration is going to suspend immigration from terror-prone regions. And we will suspend the Syrian refugee program. That was easy. \n\nWe're not going to take the risk when it comes to the safety of the American people. No longer. So let me state this as clearly as I can. If I'm elected president, I am going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. \n\nHillary also said she wants totally open borders. \n\nNo one who supports open borders can ever serve as president of the United States. Totally open borders. A Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. And yes, we will build a wall. \n\nHave to. We have to.\n\n Build that wall. Build that wall. Build that wall.\n\nAnd who is going to pay for the wall? \n\nOne hundred percent. Mexico, in terms of our trade deficits, is making a fortune off the United States. Their leaders are doing a much smarter job. But you know what? We'll be happy with Mexico. Mexico's gonna be wonderful, we're going to have a great relationship with Mexico, with China and with other - we don't even have good relationships now. They rip us off and we still don't get along. At least they should be nice to us. They're not even nice. They'll be nice.\n\nThousands of Americans have been killed by illegal immigrants. Right here in Ohio. Sixty-year old Margaret Costleman was murdered in cold blood by an illegal immigrant. Earlier that day her killer shot another woman in the arm while she was with her children in a nearby park. Police encountered the man more than three weeks before the crime scene, but federal authorities refused to take him into custody, even though people were saying, \"Please, please don't let him out. Please take him in.\"\n\nThen there is the case of 90-year old Earl Olander, a Minnesota farmer who was brutally beaten by illegal immigrants and left to bleed to death in his home. Earl's body was found with his hands bound behind his back with duct tape. A blunt force injury to his head. His killers had criminal records but they did not meet the Obama administration's priorities for removal. \n\nBut others that knew him and others that knew them were pleading, were pleading, \"Don't let them out. Don't let them into our society.\" I have a message for the cartels, the drug dealers and the gang members. When I win, your long reign of crime and terror and horror will come to a very beautiful crashing end. \n\nWe will also repeal Obama-Clinton defense cuts and rebuild our badly depleted military. Our Air Force is the smallest and oldest it's ever been. Did you know that? Because I know what you have here. You guys are good with Wright Patterson. Right? What a great place. But we're very depleted, we have old equipment. We will build brand new, modern, state of the art planes to fly right at 'em, right at Wright Patterson Air Force Base. We have a lot of veterans here today.\n\nI want to thank them for their service and let them know as president I have your back. Believe me. \n\nI have your back. We will. She just said, \"Make America great again, Mr. Trump.\" We will make America great again. Don't worry about it. We will. And it won't take too long. We will change our foreign policy. Hillary Clinton's policies in Iraq, Syria, Libya threw the Middle East into total turmoil. We're spending $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East while our own country falls into total disrepair. Now Hillary wants to start a shooting war in Syria, conflict with a nuclear power - Russia - which could very well lead to World War III.\n\nAnd the way she talks about Putin. She's always said she has no idea, but she's always saying Wikileak, it's Russia, and Donald Trump I have nothing to do with Russia.\n\nShe said maybe Donald Trump is involved in projects with the Russians. The answer's no, no. But what she does, she says Donald Trump and Russia. Look, look, she speaks so badly of Putin, nuclear country, she speaks so badly, I say and she uses it to keep trying to get votes.\n\nI said to myself you know, how do you speak so badly of somebody, I mean how are they going to ever get along? Wouldn't it be great if we actually got along with Russia and other countries? \n\nAnd we together went after ISIS and knocked the hell out of them? Wouldn't that be a good thing? \n\nBecause they want to get them out also. \n\nBut she speaks very badly of Putin, and I don't think that's smart, you know. You can be very tough, but you shouldn't be doing what she's doing. As her own team has said in Wikileaks, she has terrible instincts. To all Americans I say it's time for new leadership, it really is time. \n\nIt really is. \n\nCan you imagine four more years of Obama? That's what you got to \n\nIt's high taxes, it's high regulations, all these companies they can't even breathe with the regulations, unnecessary. It's ISIS all over the place. You know, she says she'll stop ISIS. Let me tell you, there was no ISIS. There was no ISIS. During her term, she created with Obama a vacuum in Iraq, ISIS formed, and then Obama called them the JV, junior varsity, right?\n\nWell they're not the JV anymore, folks. They're going to be no trouble, we are going to knock them so hard. But look, look, they're not the JV, and they weren't them. And now they're in 32 different countries. So she's saying we will get rid of ISIS. She wants to go back home and go to sleep, that's what she wants to do. \n\nDid you see where she got upset yesterday because I took a little while, just a few hours, to cut a ribbon to make sure my kids did a good job? We built the building by the way, under budget, and ahead of schedule. \n\nAnd she said Donald Trump got off the campaign trail. I mean I've been doing six, seven, eight things a day every single day. She's home sleeping half the time. \n\nI say she's definitely a low energy person. I said where is Hillary? I watched after the last debate, and after the second debate. She was tired, wow. \n\nShe walked off that stage, she had a lot of people around, they had a lot of people around her, which was smart. Everything will change in November. Just think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days. \n\nWe're going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan.\n\nWe're going to eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation. \n\nWe're going to provide school choice and put an end to Common Core. \n\nWe're going to rebuild our military, and take care of our vets. \n\nWe will support the truly great men and women of law enforcement. \n\nWe are going to save our second amendment which is under siege. \n\nAnd we'll appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court, so important, who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. \n\nAmericans are tired of being told by politicians they have to defer their dreams to another day, but they really mean another decade. It's like our politics are caught in time loop. We keep electing the same people over and over again, Clinton, Clinton, oh, Clinton, the impeachment, the lying, the whole thing.\n\nWe're going to keep make the same mistakes if you keep doing that, and we are going to continue to hear the same old excuses. These career politicians keep telling us that things can't change, that we can't find new solutions. That's basically what they tell us.\n\nWell I have a message for them. The future belongs to the dreamers, not the cynics, and not the critics. The future belongs to the dreamers. \n\nI'm asking all Americans to join me in dreaming big and bold things for our future. I'm going to fight for every American, of every background, in every stretch of this nation. I'm going to fight to liberate our citizens from violence and poverty, and crime and fear.\n\nAnd I'm going to fight for the inner cities, and for the African- American community, and the way they're forced to live in the inner cities with no jobs, no education, and no safety. \n\nI'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people, not the donors, and not the special \n\nI'm going to fight to bring us all together as Americans. Just imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together again as one people under one God, saluting one American flag. \n\nThat's right, once again we will have a government of, by, and for the people. \n\nYou gotta get out and vote. It's going to be something special. And I tell you this, and I tell others this sometimes, this is amazing group of people, the spirit, the energy, the genius, the genius. But you will say that this will be one of the great and most important meetings of your life, but most importantly, you will say that this vote will be the most important vote you've ever cast. \n\nBecause our country doesn't win anymore. We don't win with trade, we don't win with our great military, we don't allow them to win, we don't win with ISIS\n\nThe world is laughing at us. We don't win at the borders. We don't win with taking care of our vets. We don't win with anything. We don't win anymore. We will start winning again like you've never seen before. \n\nAnd I kiddingly say that one of our great two congressmen that are here someplace where are those great guys? They're here. They're going to be coming to see me at the White House, and they're going to say Mr. President, Mr. President sir, Mr. President \n\nThe people of Ohio, they can't take it anymore, sir. You're winning too much.\n\nYou knocked out ISIS, there are too many jobs in Ohio, too many companies are pouring in. We have a little traffic. Traffic wouldn't be a bad thing \n\nWe are going to win like never before. \n\nWe are going to make our country wealthy again. We are going to make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again.\n\nThank you very much. Thank you, everybody. \n\nMake sure you go out and vote. God bless you. God bless you.\u0000","78":"Thank you, everybody, thank you. Wow. These crowds. \nThese crowds are terrific. Thank you very much. In six days, we are going to win the great state of Florida. And we are going to win back the White House. That will happen. But you have to get out, you have to vote, we have to get out there. We don't want to blow it.\n\nThat I can tell you because we have worked very hard, all of us, you, me, everybody. And it's very historic what's happening. I'd like to begin today by thanking all of you for joining me. This has been an incredible journey and we've all done it together. We're almost at the end. \n\nBut we're really at the end of the beginning if you think about it. Aren't we? The end of the beginning. Our magnificent history movement has surprised the world and defied expectations at every single turn.\n\nAnd now, next Tuesday, we will have one last glorious surprise for the pundits, the politicians and the special interests and return the power back to the people. It's going to happen. \n\nIt's going to happen. It's been the honor of my life share this journey with you, it has absolutely been. \n\nThere are two people, however, who I did not really get to share this with but who are in my thoughts often. And that's my mother and my father, great people. \n\nI had great parents. Great parents. I know they're up there watching, I just felt that nice breeze. It's hot, but I just felt that nice breeze \n\nSo they're helping us out. And I just want to say thank you to both of them. Special, special people. I've had a great life and now I want to give back to the country that I love. It's time, we have to we have to give back, folks \n\nI've seen how the career of politicians, the big donors and the special interests have bled this country dry and stripped our middle class and stripped our companies of its jobs and its wealth. But we're just six days away from delivering justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this country\n\nJustice for every child trapped in poverty in the inner cities, for every family that's born--and you know that, they've been born into a situation in some case; they can't get out of it. We're going to get them out of it. We're going to get them out of it.\n\nWe have endless wars. Every community's hopes and dreams have been shattered and we're not going to let that happen. Our inner cities are going to come back and they're going to come back strong and your going to see what I mean. \n\nAnd the African-American community and the Hispanic community are really understanding what's going on and you see that right now. You see that right now in what's happening at the polls.\n\nWe're winning in Florida, we're winning in Ohio, we're winning in Iowa, in North Carolina. We're doing great in Pennsylvania. A lot of people are saying Pennsylvania's looking very good. So many different places.\n\nWe just got a poll with three up in Virginia. \n\nBut we are seriously up in Florida. That's very important \n\nAnd I will never, ever let you down. Real change begins immediately with repealing and replacing Obamacare, a disaster. \n\nA disaster. \n\nIt is a disaster. It's just been announced that the residents of Florida are going to experience a massive double digit premium hike. \n\nI will not tell you what the number is. I know the number very well, but I want you to leave happy. You don't want to hear the number, go home, relax, wake up good and strong tomorrow morning. You'll learn, you're not going to like it.\n\nIn the great state of Arizona, where we just left, the premiums are going up more than 116 percent. \n\nOver 90 percent of the counties in Florida and by the way, in the primaries, I won 66 out of 67 primaries. That's good. \n\nI was going to try and exaggerate and say I won them all, but I can't do that. Over 90 percent of the counties in Florida are losing Obamacare insurers next year, they're leaving. They're all leaving.\n\nIn Minnesota where the premium increase will be close to 60 percent, the Democratic governor has said the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable. Obamacare is a total catastrophe.\n\nYet Hillary Clinton wants to double down on Obamacare, making it even more expensive. \n\nI'm asking for your vote so we can replace Obamacare and save healthcare for every family in Florida, so important. \n\nReal change also means restoring honesty to our government. \n\nAs you know, the FBI has reopened its investigation into crooked Hillary Clinton. \n\nHillary wants to blame everyone else for amounting legal troubles and I don't see if you've watched her last few speeches over the last few days. She has become totally unhinged, unbelievable.\n\nWhat she's saying and what she's doing is actually, it's unbelievable. But she has no one to blame but herself. Hillary is the one who set up the illegal private e-mail server to shield her criminal activity.\n\nHillary is the one who engaged in a corrupt pay for play scheme at the State Department. Hillary is the one who lied so many times to Congress and to the FBI. Hilary is the one who made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer and who destroyed 33,000 e-mails after, after, after, after receiving a congressional subpoena, think of that. \n\nUnbelievable. \n\nAnd as you know, they just found--listen to this and I guess you know it, 650,000 e-mails. \n\nAnd I would say that classified, confidential, I think they're probably all over the place. I think they're--I think they're gonna find a treasure trough. I can't even imagine.\n\nIn fact, they said well, this is OK they're duplicates. How could there be duplicates when its many more times what we thought was stolen in the first place, right?\n\nYou know, when they deleted 33,000 I thought that was a lot. They have 650,000? Hillary is the one who accepted debate questions given to her in advance and used them to cheat. \n\nInstead of reporting the breach. That's a big deal. You know, to me that's a big deal. Some people say oh, that's fine, that's a big deal. That's really--that's a real cheater, OK? That's a cheater.\n\nAnd she was given the questions by a woman that frankly should resigned from the DNC or be fired. \n\nBut that's a really big deal. And you notice, they never--the dishonest prospect, the most dishonest. \n\nIf you notice, they never go after Hillary. They always talk about Donna Brazile, Donna Brazile didn't do it. But can you imagine if I got--can you imagine, they gave the questions to Donald Trump before a debate. \n\nYou know it would be the electric chair. They'd reinstitute the electric chair. No.\n\nIt'd be headlines all over the world. This isn't headlines.\n\nI bring it up; it's brought up a little bit. But this isn't like a big deal. She got the debate questions and answers.\n\nBut she got the debate questions prior to a debate. Now, Bernie Sanders should be angry right? Shouldn't he be angry?\n\nNow, I'll tell you what. The system is rigged. The system is rigged.\n\nI've been saying it for a--it's rigged, and we're gonna straighten it out. But the system is rigged. Hillary is not the victim; the American people are the victims of this system. \n\nSo corrupt in so many ways. And this is your one chance to change it because you know what?\n\nIn four years, not gonna happen. There's no way. The numbers won't work.\n\nIn four years, there's no way. Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency. And if she were to be elected, it would create an unprecedented constitutional crisis.\n\nI mean before you go into phase two--let's call what happened on Friday phase two. Phase one, she's so guilty. She shouldn't be allowed to run for the presidency.\n\nThat's why I say the system is rigged. She shouldn't be allowed to run. But I have a feeling in the 650,000 e-mails, they're gonna find things that you will not even believe.\n\nWho knows. 650,000 e-mails. No wonder she can't do anything.\n\nNo, no. How do you work? How do you do it?\n\n650,000. They'll have to explain that to us some day.\n\nBut they'll have some things in there that I can just imagine are going to be unbelievable. Hillary's likely to be under investigation for many years. Probably concluding in a criminal trial.\n\nOut today, WikiLeaks just came out with a new one. Just a little while ago. It's just been shown that a rigged system with more collusion, possibly illegal between the Department of Justice, the Clinton campaign, and the State Department.\n\nYou saw that. The e-mails show that the Assistant Attorney General who's involved in the investigation has been feeding information directly to John Podesta and the Clinton campaign. Can you believe this? \n\nShe shouldn't be allowed to run.\n\nBy the way, behind me, the great Johnny Damon. The curse of the Yankees, but ultimately he helped the Yankees. Johnny Damon.\n\nStand up Johnny. \n\nNow, I'll tell ya. George Steinbrenner was a good friend of mine. Oh, he didn't like Johnny too much.\n\nThen he ultimately signed him and then he was fine. He did great.\n\nBut Johnny Damon was a champ. He was a winner. And he loves this area, you know that. My contract with the American voter begins with a tough ethics reform, and it ends--I'll tell you what. We are going to end--we have no choice.\n\nWe really have no choice--government corruption. It's going to end. \n\nI want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and to heed the words we all will say right now when we win on November 8. We are going to Washington, D.C. and we are going to drain the swamp. \n\nAt the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs. Florida has lost one in four of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton with the support of crooked Hillary. \n\nAmerica has lost--this is so hard to believe--70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization.\n\nAnother Bill and Hillary backed disaster. We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. A Trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving America, and we will stop the jobs from leaving Florida. They're leaving. We're going to stop it\n\nAnd you have an excellent governor, by the way. He's fighting hard for you folks. I don't know--I don't know. All I can tell you is he is a worker, he is a worker, and he's fighting very hard. The theft of American prosperity will end and it'll end, I'll tell you. We are--it is being stolen from us folks.\n\nIt is--we have a one-way highway right into Mexico, right into other countries. And we're going to stop it. From now on, it's going to be America first. \n\nAmerica first. \n\nIt's going to be America first. \n\nA Trump administration will renegotiate NAFTA and we will stand up to foreign product dumping, currency manipulation, and all of the unfair subsidy behaviors. It's horrible what's happening to us. Our politicians don't have a clue, they don't know what they're doing--or other things, OK. We will also immediately stop the job killing Trans-Pacific Partnership. As part of our plan to bring back jobs, we're going to lower taxes on American business from 35 percent to 15 percent. We're the highest taxed nation in the world. Killing our jobs. Our companies are leaving. Killing our jobs.\n\nWe will become a rich nation once again. But to be a rich nation, we must also be a safe nation. In Orlando, the murder rate doubled, you know that? Doubled last year. Can you believe it? We will support our police, and I met you police of Orlando, they are unbelievable people and they've been through a lot.\n\nI met the police and these are unbelievable people. We will bring this crime wave to an end. We will also keep our community safe from terrorism. Just a short time ago, Orlando was the victim of the worst mass shooting in American history during the Islamic terror attack on The Pulse nightclub.\n\nIt was also the worst attack on the LGBTQ community in our country's history. Can't let it happen, can't let it happen. Hillary wants to increase by 550 percent Syrian refugees pouring into our country. \n\nHer plan would mean generations of terrorism, radicalism, and extremism spreading in your schools and throughout your communities.\n\nWhen I'm elected president, we will suspend the Syrian refuge program. \n\nAnd we will keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of your community. \n\nGot to keep them out. And we'll build safe zones in Syria. We have to help the people. We're going to build safe zones, but the Gulf States haven't been doing their thing.\n\nAnd believe me, they have plenty of money. They'll help us, they'll fund it, I'm sure they'll be thrilled. They're going to be funding it, and that will be OK. We want to help people. But we have enough problems in this country. We don't need Orlando and problems. We don't need what happened in San Bernadino.\n\nWe don't need what's happening in Paris, in Nice and in Germany--which is a disaster. We don't need it. We have enough problems right now, do we agree? We have enough problems. We don't need it. A Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. \n\nAnd yes, we will build a great wall. \n\nWe received the first ever endorsement from our ICE and border patrol officers, great people. The officers that warned that Hillary's plan is the most quote, radical immigration proposal in United States history, and that it will lead to the loss of thousands and thousands of lives, quote.\n\nAs Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of the most dangerous and violent criminal aliens to go free because their home countries were intelligent, they wouldn't take them back.\n\nWe bring them to their countries--murderers, drug dealers, gang members, we'd bring them to their countries and their countries would say: get them out, we're not taking them back. They call up the State Department, and the State Department under Hillary Clinton would say: oh, bring them back, we don't want to make waves.\n\nI guarantee you, whether it's four years or eight years, that will not happen once under a Trump administration. \n\nHillary wants totally open borders and strongly supports sanctuary cities. Like San Francisco, where Kate Steinle--incredible young woman--was murdered by an illegal immigrant who had been deported five times.\n\nA Trump administration will cancel all federal funding to sanctuary cities immediately. We will end illegal immigration, deport all criminal aliens--the ones we just spoke about--and we will save American lives. We will also repeal Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our very badly depleted military. \n\nThat includes major new investments in resources from Pensacola Naval Air Station at MacDill Air Force Base. Have you ever heard of those places? Pretty good places. A lot of people here, lot of people. I'm honored to have the endorsement of 200--more than that now, much more than that--top Admirals and Generals and 22 Medal of Honor recipients.\n\nGreat people, I've met so many of them, they're incredible. Incredible people. Our new foreign policy will put America first. Hillary and our failed Washington establishment have spend $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East that we never won and that never end. And it's now in worse shape than ever before.\n\nThe Middle East is a catastrophe, it's far worse off than had we spent nothing.\n\nThey've dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe. They've left our borders wide open at home. And they've shipped our jobs and wealth to other countries. And it's--it's disappearing. Our country, in a certain sense, is disappearing. Prosperity--real prosperity is disappearing. We owe $20 trillion. Our trade deals, we lose $800 billion a year on trade. We have trade deficits. Think of that. Who negotiates these deals?\n\nYou know who does? Stupid people. Stupid people. \n\nWith very stupid leadership. Who, by the way, they campaign all the time. He's campaigning right now for crooked Hillary. \n\nWhy is he campaigning? She's under federal investigation, and we've got a president campaigning for her. And that's all he does is campaign. He ought to be working on your jobs that are leaving and going to Mexico. And your military. \n\nI'll tell you what, first of all, she's got bigger problems. But four more years of Obama, we can't take it, folks. Four more years of ISIS, that's what it is. Four more years of no jobs.\n\nNow, she wants to start a shooting war in Syria and conflict with a nuclear-armed Russia that could very well lead to World War III. Russia is heavily armed, doesn't like her. Putin does not respect her, doesn't like her. What are we doing, folks? She's a mess.\n\nTo all Americans, I say it's time for new leadership. \n\nJust think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days of a Trump administration. \n\nThank you. It's so beautiful over there. I just noticed the water. Let's go in for a swim. It's about 200 degrees out there.\n\nAnybody want to go swimming? Let's go. \n\nWe are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan. And Hillary wants to increase your taxes by a tremendous amount. You know, we're already the highest-taxed nation in the world. She wants to increase your taxes, if you can believe that one.\n\nWe're going to eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation. Killing your companies. Killing them. One of the reasons they're leaving. Cancel every illegal Obama executive order. \n\nWe're going to rebuild our military and take care of our great, great veterans. They're not being taken care of. You know that. A lot of veterans here. We're going to take care of our veterans finally. They have been mistreated for many, many years.\n\nWe're going to support the men and women of law enforcement. \n\nWe will save the Second Amendment which is, as you know, under tremendous siege. \n\nWe will appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. \n\nWe will show the world that there is no challenge too great, no dream outside of our reach. There's no dream--no dream outside of our reach. We have all these people telling us what to do. Politicians--they know nothing. I've dealt with them all my life, folks. All talk, no action.\n\nI have some friends that are politicians. So let me just say there's some good ones. OK? There are some good.\n\nI'll tell you what, you take a look at the media. These are the most dishonest people anywhere. \n\nThese are the most--they--the media--the media is a part and one of the vital cogs in the rigged system under which we live. They're a big fat cog in the--and they never show the crowds. They never show what's happening.\n\nBut you know what? You hear--when you hear 20,000, sometimes 30,000, when you hear people, sounds like you're at an Ohio State football game. \n\nBut they never show it. They never show it. \n\nThey never show it.\n\nPeople of Florida, we love you. All we have to do is cut our ties with these failed politicians of the past. Hillary is a candidate of yesterday. We are the movement of the future. We are. \n\nWe're asking for the votes of Republicans, Democrats, independents and first-time voters, of which we're finding out there are many. You probably heard over the last couple of weeks \"Texas is in play\"; \"Texas--that Georgia is in play.\" And I'm saying, \"Gee, that's too bad.\"\n\nLet me tell you, they're setting records in Texas, and they're voting for Trump, just so you understand that. \n\nAnd they know it. \n\nBut when they see those numbers coming, they don't want to announce them. But we are winning almost everywhere. I think--give us two more days, I think we're going to be winning everywhere. \n\nAnd I'm almost starting to think that the least important problem that Hillary has is the fact that we're winning. I think she's got perhaps bigger problems than even that. \n\nWe're fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people, not the donors and nor Hillary's special interests. \n\nWe are fighting to unlock the potential of every American community and every American family who hope and pray and yearn for a much better future. \n\nI am asking you to dream big--I got to dream big. Because with your vote, we are just--can you believe this?--six days away. Think of that. \n\nFrom the change you've been waiting for your entire life. \n\nWe're going to work together. We're going to vote. You're going to vote now or you're going to vote by the 8th. But you're going to vote.\n\nThank you. I love that guy. He's a tough guy, but he just screamed out, \"You're going to win.\" We're going to win. Thank you, man. Thank you. \n\nWe have great, great love.\n\nYou know, we're in a divided nation. We are a divided nation. We're not going to be divided. We're going to have such love in this country. We're going to have such love and such respect.\n\nTogether, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. \n\nWe will make America safe again. \n\nAnd we will make America great again. \n\nThank you very much. Thank you, folks. God bless you, everybody. God bless you. \n\nThank you. Get out and vote. Get out and vote. Thank you.\u0000","79":"Thank you.\nIn 18 days, we are going to win the state of North Carolina and we are going to win the White House.\n\nOur opponents have spent more money than ever before in the history of campaigns -- raised from special interests -- and yet we are leading in the polls from Rasmussen, LA Times, and Investor's Business Daily.\n\nEarly voting is underway, so make sure to send in your ballot.\n\nTogether, we are going to deliver real change that puts America First.\n\nWe are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals, end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, reduce surging crime, cut taxes and regulations, unleash job-producing American energy, rebuild our military and take care of our Vets, and repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.\n\nYour jobs will come back under a Trump Administration. Your incomes will go up under a Trump Administration. Your taxes will go way down under a Trump Administration. Your companies won't be leaving North Carolina under a Trump Administration.\n\nWe will be a strong nation again. American Leadership has grown so weak, that the Philippines have broken with decades of pro-American foreign policy to instead leave for the orbit of China and Russia.\n\nStrength will also require growth.\n\nRight now, our economy isn't growing at all. We had only around 1% growth in the last quarter. I'm going to get us to 4% growth and create 25 million jobs over 10 years.\n\nMany workers are earning less today than they were 18 years ago, they are working harder and longer, but making less. Some of them are working two, three jobs but still taking home less money.\n\nCompanies, like Carrier are firing their workers and moving to Mexico.\n\nFord is moving all of its small car production to Mexico.\n\nWhen I'm President, if companies want to fire their workers and leave for Mexico, then we will charge them a 35% tax when they want to ship their products back into the United States. That means the companies won't leave in the first place and, if they do, we'll at least make money when they ship their products across the border.\n\nHillary Clinton has raised countless millions of dollars from big donors who want to ship our jobs to other countries - including millions of dollars from corporations and countries pushing the Trans-Pacific Partnership. That's how our system is corrupt and broken.\n\nWe're going to take on big donors, big business and big media that have enriched themselves at your expense.\n\nThe media is so corrupt that Hillary was given the exact questions to a previous debate, word for word, by Donna Brazile - who is now under tremendous pressure to resign.\n\nHillary was given the questions, used the questions, and never said that she did something that was totally inappropriate.\n\nYears ago there was a show called the $64,000 question - a contestant got the questions in advance, his life was ruined.\n\nThis is even bigger, because we are playing for the presidency of the United States.\n\nHillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the Presidency.\n\nNow, from WikiLeaks, we've just learned she tried to get $12 million from the King of Morocco for an appearance - more pay-for-play.\n\nThat is why I am proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again.\n\nIt's time to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C.\n\nThose reforms include the following:\n\nA 5 year-ban on White House and Congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they leave government service.\n\nA lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government.\n\nA complete ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections.\n\nAdditionally, I am going to push for a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress.\n\nNot only will we end government corruption, but we will end economic stagnation.\n\nMy plan for the economy can be summed up in three simple words: Jobs, Jobs, Jobs\n\nAt the center of my historic jobs plan will be fixing our terrible trade deals.\n\n47 million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are on Food Stamps.\n\nWe have nearly an $800 billion dollar annual trade deficit in goods with the world, and the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.\n\nNorth Carolina has lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton.\n\nWe've lost 70,000 factories since China's entry into the World Trade Organization - another Bill and Hillary-backed deal.\n\nWe are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.\n\nA Trump Administration is going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to foreign cheating, and stop the jobs from leaving our country.\n\nWe are going to start making things in America again - and we are going to start making things in North Carolina again.\n\nIn order to bring manufacturing back to North Carolina, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and so many other places, we are going to undertake a major reform of our federal bureaucracy.\n\nAmerican trade policy is currently mismanaged by dozens of competing bureaucracies spread across the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Labor, State and Treasury Department and the U.S. Trade Representative.\n\nIn my administration, all trade policymaking will be consolidated into one Office. It will report to what we call the American Desk. The mission of the American Desk will be to protect the economic interests of the American worker, and the national interests of the United States.\n\nIt's going to be America First.\n\nAs part of our plan to bring back our jobs, we are going to lower our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent.\n\nWe are also going to rebuild our inner cities.\n\nAfrican- Americans and Hispanics living in the inner cities are suffering.\n\nThe violence is unbearable. You walk to the store with your child and you get shot.\n\nThere is no education, there are no jobs, there is no safety.\n\nNearly 3,500 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.\n\nHomicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore. And it's getting worse.\n\nTo the African-American and Hispanic voters suffering, I say: what do you have to lose?\n\nVote for Donald Trump. I will fix it.\n\nWe will be a rich nation once again.\n\nBut to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country.\n\nNational Security begins at the border.\n\nSpeaking in secret to a foreign bank Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally \"open trade and open borders.\"\n\nHillary's plan includes an open border with the Middle East - meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within our shores.\n\nSo let me state this as clearly as I can.\n\nIf I'm elected President I am going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country.\n\nWe will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration.\n\nA Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders. And yes, we will build a wall.\n\nWe have the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers.\n\nAs Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be released because their home countries wouldn't take them back.\n\nIt was just reported that a man deported from our country 10 times in six years has been charged with raping a 12-year old girl. In August, Texas Police arrested a serial illegal immigrant rapist who had been deported five times, his victims included one 68 year-old woman with a cane who took his offer to drive her home. He left her on the side of a dirt road.\n\nA 64 year-old Air Force Veteran, Marilyn Pharis, was raped and beaten to death with a hammer by a repeat-offending criminal illegal immigrant who should have been deported - but never was.\n\nWhat kind of government allows its citizens to suffer such horrors?\n\nEither we win this election, or we lose the country.\n\nA victory in November will be a victory for you, the American people.\n\nHere are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:\n\nWe are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation; defend religious liberty; provide school choice to every low-income child in America, and we are going to end Common Core; support the men and women of law enforcement; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\n\nYou have 18 days to make every dream you ever dreamed of for your country come true.\n\nOur campaign is powered by our love for this country and our love for our fellow citizens.\n\nIt's a campaign about rejecting the cynicism and elitism of our failed political establishment.\n\nI am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation.\n\nI'm going to fight for every child living in poverty.\n\nI'm going to fight for every mom who lost her child to illegal immigration, and drugs and gang violence.\n\nI'm going to fight for every community whose jobs and factories have been ripped out of states like North Carolina and shipped to other countries.\n\nI'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people - not the donors and special interests.\n\nAnd I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.\n\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\n\nYou're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life.\n\nYou're going to remember this day.\n\nThis is a movement like you've never seen before.\n\nYou're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most\n\nimportant vote you've ever cast for anyone at any time.\n\nBecause if we win -\n\nWe Will Make America Wealthy Again.\n\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\n\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\n\nAnd We Will Make America Great Again.\u0000","80":"Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much. \nSenator, Governor and Rudy, thank you very much.\n\nWow, what a group! What a group!\n\nVery excited, very, very excited to be with you tonight. Thank you very much. \n\nThe people of Jackson and the state of Mississippi have such incredible energy, that very powerful word \"energy,\" unbelievable, incredible energy and spirit, folks. Thank you very much.\n\nAnd thank you for all the support you've given me right from the beginning. I will not forget it, Mississippi. We love Mississippi right from the beginning, right from the beginning. \n\nThis is the spirit we need to rebuild our country a hundred percent. \n\nAnd this is our chance to break free from the bitter failures of the past and to create a new American future. \n\nTo everyone watching across our nation right now, to everyone who has been let down by our terrible, terrible politicians, I am asking for your vote on November 8th. \n\nThis is your chance to remove the special interests from their throne of power and to once again have a government of, by and for the people. \n\nNo one will be left behind anymore. \n\nI'd like to take this moment to send our thoughts and prayers to everyone at the American University in Kabul, Afghanistan. They are going through a lot.\n\nWe must defeat radical Islamic terrorism! \n\nAnyone who will not name our enemy is not fit to lead our country. \n\nEight years of Obama\/Clinton policies have sacrificed our safety and undermined our freedom and independence. Our jobs have moved to other countries. Islamic terrorism has spread within our shores. And an open border has crushed low-income workers and threatened, and I mean totally threatened, our security. \n\nThe issues we face here in America are similar to the issues faced in Britain during their referendum on membership in the European Union. This is the movement known as Brexit.\n\nOn June 23rd, the people of Britain voted to declare their independence, which is what we're looking to do also, folks \n\nFrom their international government which hasn't worked. They voted to break away from rule by large corporations and media executives who believe in a world without borders. \n\nThey voted to reclaim control over immigration, over their economy, over their government. \n\nWorking people and the great people of the U.K. took control of their destiny. \n\nThe people profiting from the rigged system, and it is rigged, we're finding it out every single day, the multinational banks, the media celebrities, the big donors tried to scare the British people out of voting for change. The same thing is happening right here in the United States. It's happening.\n\nAll the people benefiting from our rigged system don't want things to change. They want you to believe things can't be changed.\n\nAnd they can so easily, so easily and so smartly.\n\nAnd we all know things have to change. We have no choice. And they have to change right now. \n\nBefore the vote, I said that Britain would leave the EU, sometimes referred to as European Union, and I said it and I took a lot of heat when I said it. People said, what does he know, what does he know? And guess what? I was very supportive of their right to do it and to take control of their own future, like exactly what we're going to be voting for on November 8th. \n\nHillary Clinton, who has been on the wrong side of history in every major decision, she's only made bad decisions, she's got bad judgment, she doesn't know what she's doing, folks. \n\nShe got this one wrong, too.\n\nShe got this one wrong, too, folks. She got this one wrong, too. She gets them all wrong. She gets them all wrong, doesn't she? She really got the e-mails wrong, that I can tell you. \n\nAnd now Hillary wants to surrender America to globalism, just what we don't want. \n\nShe wants a country without borders. She wants trade deals written for the benefit of foreign corporations. She wants a government that ignores the will of the people. \n\nShe wants to sell out American security to the Clinton Foundation for a big, fat pile of cash. \n\nIt's hard to tell where the Clinton Foundation ends and where the State Department begins.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, more than half the meetings she took as secretary of state with people outside government were with foundation donors. \n\nHillary Clinton does not believe in America first. We believe in America first. \n\nHillary believes in donors first and special interests and lobbyists. She will never straighten out our country. She doesn't have the strength, the stamina or the ability to straighten out our country. We'll have four more years of Obama and that's just what we don't want. \n\nShe would rather give a job to a refugee from overseas than an unemployed American veteran or to an unemployed African American or Hispanic. \n\nThe job of a public official is to serve and protect the citizens of the United States \n\nNot illegal immigrants, not foreign nationals seeking entry, but the people living here lawfully today, including millions of African-American and Hispanic citizens, millions, millions being treated very, very unfairly, I can tell you that.\n\nMy focus will always be on the well-being of more than 300 million American citizens who call this country home and who love their country. \n\nI will fight for their security. I will fight for their jobs. We will not let jobs be taken out of our country, be ripped out of our country and moved to Mexico and many other countries. We will not let it happen anymore. \n\nWe'll be fighting for their jobs and we'll be fighting for your families, that I can tell you. It ends. What's been going on ends on November 8th. \n\nWe will have one American nation, not divided, we will be together. Hillary Clinton has betrayed her duty to the people. November 8th is our chance to re-declare American independence. \n\nThis is a great honor for me. I am going right now to invite onto the stage the man behind Brexit and a man who led brilliantly the United Kingdom Independence Party in this fight and won despite all odds, despite horrible name-calling, despite so many obstacles.\n\nWow! Thank you, Nigel.\n\nWhat a job! What a job he did. What a job he did against all odds.\n\nThank you, Nigel.\n\nThat was some job that he did against all odds. Everybody said it couldn't be done. And by the way, it's looking like a very wise decision right now by the voters, so I really congratulate Nigel and I thank you for being here. Thank you. \n\nAnd if I may, we had some tremendous polls come out today. I won't bring it up, I refuse to mention it, but they were very good. We're leading in a lot of locations. \n\nThank you.\n\nIt's time for America to recapture, like you just heard, to recapture our destiny. Our government leaders and our media have totally lost touch with the people. They have, they have totally lost touch.\n\nYou need no better evidence of that then the fact that the media ignores the plight of Americans who have lost their children to illegal immigrants, but spends day after day pushing for amnesty for those here in total violation of the law. We can't allow that. \n\nWhy do our leaders spend so much time talking about how to help people here illegally, they're here illegally, and they spend and they work and they try so hard to help them, but they don't try helping American citizens, some of whom have been devastated by what's happened to their children and their families? Devastated.\n\njobs, wages and security for Americans. \n\nAnd the immigration policy I support as president must pass these three tests. First, it must improve jobs and wages for United States citizens. \n\nWe have people in this room who were making more money in real wages 18 years ago, were not working as hard as they're working now and they've gotten older, not supposed to be that way, and in many cases and largely because of the disaster known as \"Obamacare\" they have to hold two jobs, not one, but two jobs and, in some cases, three jobs.\n\nNot going to happen, folks, not going to happen.\n\nSecond, it must improve the safety and security for United States citizens. \n\nThird, it must improve the quality of life for U.S. citizens. The quality of life, our quality of life is going down.\n\nOur level of security, you look back years, you're more insecure now in terms of security than you were 10, 15 and 20 years ago.\n\nHillary Clinton's radical immigration plan fails these tests and it fails them very, very badly. Her push for open borders will lower the wages and kill the jobs of lawful American residents. \n\nHer support for catch-and-release will put innocent American lives at risk and already has, just like President Obama released the illegal immigrant at the border who then killed magnificent, magnificent Sarah Root.\n\nYesterday I met with her mom, Michelle. Hillary Clinton only talks about the separation of families who choose to come here illegally. I want to focus on the American families who have been permanently separated from their children because of the sanctuary cities and open borders that Hillary Clinton so strongly supports. \n\nWhere is the sanctuary for American children? Where is that sanctuary? The dreamers we never talk about are the young Americans. Why aren't young Americans dreamers also? I want my dreamers to be young Americans. \n\nHillary Clinton also wants to push to bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term \n\nA large number of whom come from large countries where women and gays are horribly brutalized, which will weaken our tolerant way of life.\n\nI only want to bring people to our country who share our values and love our people and are capable of loving America. \n\nImportantly, I will also create millions and millions of jobs for our people. \n\nWe are going to cut taxes, reduce regulations, fix our trade deals, unleash American energy and repeal and replace the horror show known as \"Obamacare.\" \n\nWe are going to create jobs, jobs, jobs! \n\nI will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created, believe me. \n\nSo we're going to have millions and millions of jobs, jobs like you have never seen in this country before, because our jobs are being stolen from us, our companies are being stolen from us, our manufacturing is down by 40 percent and 50 percent and numbers that nobody even believes. Those days will be over if Donald Trump is elected president of the United States, believe me. \n\nRising incomes, higher wages, thousands of new companies all across this nation, they'll come in and they'll form. We are going to renegotiate the worst trade deal ever made, not only in this country, but anywhere in the world, known as NAFTA and signed by Bill Clinton. \n\nWe're going to stand up to China on trade. We're going to keep out of what will be a disastrous trade deal, Trans-Pacific Partnership, TPP. \n\nIt will not happen with me. It will absolutely happen with crooked Hillary, believe me.\n\nThis state has lost more than 40 percent of its manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton signed NAFTA, and it's lost one in four manufacturing jobs since he put China into the World Trade Organization, both deals supported by Hillary Clinton. Horrible deals, destructive deals, what those deals have done to our jobs and to our country.\n\nWe are going to bring back jobs to Mississippi \n\nAnd in North Carolina, which has treated me so well, and Ohio and to Michigan where our auto plants are leaving and leaving and leaving and going to Mexico and other places, and to Pennsylvania, where I went to school, and to Maryland and all across this land. We're going to bring our jobs back and we're not going to let our jobs be taken away. \n\nThank you. Thank you.\n\nAnd I'm going to make it my personal mission to bring opportunity, safety and prosperity to our very, very troubled inner cities. \n\nThe Democratic Party has failed and betrayed the African-American community. \n\nDemocratic crime policies, education policies and economic policies have produced only more crime, more broken homes and more poverty than we've ever had in those communities before. \n\nNearly four in 10 African-American children live in poverty. Fifty-eight percent of African-American youth are not working. More than 2,700 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of this year alone. \n\nViolent crime has risen 17 percent, and in America's 50 largest cities it's only going one way, folks, and that's up. Homicides are up nearly 50 percent in Washington, D.C. and more than 60 percent from last year in Baltimore.\n\nThe Democratic Party has taken the votes of African Americans totally for granted, and they've done nothing in return. \n\nThey've just assumed they'll get your support and they've done nothing, absolutely nothing to deserve it.\n\nIt's time to give the Democrats some competition for African- American votes and for Hispanic votes. \n\nIt's time to rebuild the inner cities of America and do it properly. It's time to reject the failed leadership of a rigged political system. And I was the first to use that term, it's a rigged, disgusting system. \n\nTo those hurting and suffering and left behind, I say, what do you have to lose by trying something new? What do you have to lose by voting for Donald Trump for president? What do you have to lose? I will fix the problem. I will fix the problem. \n\nIf you keep voting for the same people, you will keep getting the same horrible results.\n\nBut I also want to talk about what you have to gain, right? Right? What do you have to gain? We will create school choice and allow charter schools to absolutely thrive. \n\nWhat else will we gain? We will empower young Americans to pursue their dreams of opening a small business and make it easier for them to get the credit that they need. \n\nWe will renegotiate our horrible trade deals to bring back jobs and opportunity. And the African-American community and the Hispanic community will be our biggest beneficiary of that. \n\nWe will lower taxes and unleash job creation and we will tap into trillions of dollars in new energy wealth that we never even knew we had before. \n\nWe will protect your jobs from illegal immigration and broken visa programs. And we will rebuild the roads, the bridges, the infrastructure, the tunnels, the airports in your communities and we will rebuild it with our companies, with our steel and with our labor. \n\nHillary Clinton is a bigot who sees people of color \n\nonly as votes, not as human beings worthy of a better future. She's going to do nothing for African Americans. She's going to do nothing for the Hispanics. She's only going to take care of herself, her husband, her consultants, her donors. These are the people she cares about. She doesn't care what her policies have done to your communities. She doesn't care.\n\nRemember this. You've had her policies, Democrats running some of the inner cities for 50, 70, 80, even over a hundred years. And look what you have right now, poverty, no education, crime, you can't walk down the street with your child. We're going to fix it, we're going to fix it. \n\nHillary Clinton has no remorse. I will fight to create a better future for every American. The hedge fund managers and Wall Street donors are throwing money at Hillary Clinton to try and stop our change agenda.\n\nOf course, if they start looking at the polls they may stop doing that. \n\nThey're going to have to start studying those polls. That's why you need to come out and you have to vote, you have to vote. \n\nThat is why you must make your voice heard on November 8th, have to do it. \n\nAnother crucial issue in this race is national security. Hillary Clinton may go down as the worst secretary of state that has ever served in that office. \n\nLet's look back at the Middle East at the very beginning of 2009 before the Obama\/Clinton administration, that I call a catastrophe, took over. Libya was stable. Syria was under control. Iraq was experiencing a reduction in violence. The group that would become what we now call ISIS was close to being extinguished, would never have happened. Iran was being choked off by economic sanctions.\n\nFast forward to today. After spending $4 trillion, maybe $5 trillion, nobody even knows how much money has been sucked out of our country, what have the decisions of Obama\/Clinton produced?\n\nLibya is in ruins. Our ambassador and three other brave Americans are dead. And ISIS has gained a new base of operations, they're all over the world\n\nSyria is in the midst of a totally disastrous civil war. ISIS controls large portions of the territory.\n\nA refugee crisis now threatens Europe and is threatening the United States because Hillary is allowing these people to pour into our country and we don't know who they are, where they come from. We know nothing.\n\nIraq is in chaos and ISIS is on the loose.\n\nISIS has spread across the Middle East and into the west. At the same time, ISIS is trying to infiltrate refugee flows into Europe and definitely folks, definitely, I have been very good at predicting, definitely to the United States. \n\nIran has become the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism, is now flush with up to $150 billion in cash released by the United States, plus another $400 million in cash, cash, cash ransom \n\nThat President Obama said had nothing to do with ransom, had nothing to do with the hostages, and his own people said he was wrong. \n\nHe lied. He lied. Just like he said Obamacare, \"keep your plan, you'll keep your doctor,\" 28 times, \"keep your plan, keep your doctor.\" And because of that lie, Democrats that would have never passed it passed it and now they regret that they passed it because it is a total disaster. \n\nWorst of all, the nuclear deal puts Iran, the number-one state sponsor of radical Islamic terrorism, on a path to nuclear weapons. In short, the Obama\/Clinton foreign policy has unleashed ISIS, destabilized the Middle East and put the nation of Iran, which chants, constantly chants \"death to America\" in a dominant position of regional power and in fact aspiring to be a dominant world power. And we put them there over the last three years! \n\nThis is the legacy of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton: death, destruction, terrorism and weakness. \n\nBut Hillary Clinton's legacy does not have to be America's legacy. We're going to end the era of nation-building, a disastrous concept, a disastrous era, and create new foreign policy joined by our partners in the Middle East that is focused completely on destroying ISIS. We have no choice destroying ISIS. \n\nWe will extend a hand of friendship to any nation that will work with us in good faith on this vital mission.\n\nI have a message for the terrorists trying to kill our people, our citizens, trying to hurt the world, but trying to hurt the United States: We will find you, we will destroy you and we will win! \n\nThank you. Thank you.\n\nThis is not only a military fight, but it will also require cyber warfare and financial warfare. It's also an ideological fight. We will confront directly the hateful, it's just so hateful, ideology of radical Islam and promote American values and American culture and America's system of government.\n\nOnly by standing up for and supporting, we have to stand up for and support, our values can we become a united country once again \n\nA country of great jobs and wealth, a country of security and freedom, a country of strength and unity. The future is limitless. All we have to do is believe in America once again. We have to believe it can happen. It can happen. \n\nWe will put back our faith in America's special destiny. We will lift the burdens on small business which is being driven into extinction by what's happening in our government. We'll create a level playing field for American workers. We'll never ever let what's happened to them happen to them again. We'll establish justice and opportunity and safety in every community in the land.\n\nI am asking for the vote of every citizen in this country, African American, Hispanic, all Americans, all Americans who want a better, brighter and stronger future for yourselves and for our country. \n\nI am the change candidate. This is our moment to show the whole world that America is back, bigger and better and stronger than ever before. \n\nI am asking for your vote so I can be your champion in the White House. I will be your champion and I will work hard to be your champion.\n\nAnd I won't be playing golf instead of going to see the people in Louisiana who have been devastated by floods. \n\nI'm going to be the champion to every parent who dreams for their children. And to every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I am with you, I will fight for you, and we will win for you, we will win. \n\nTogether we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, we will make America great again.\n\nThank you and God bless you. Thank you, Mississippi. We love Mississippi. God bless you. Thank you.\u0000","81":"Thank you - Wow! Well, I don't know about you, but I could listen to Elizabeth Warren go on all day! It is so great to be back here in New Hampshire! I have a significant unruly group of women I went to Wellesley with back here.\n\nOh, it is so wonderful to be here on this college campus, and to see so many young people here as Maggie and Elizabeth and I were walking up to the stage. And a lot of people were hanging out of the windows, and we're glad that you've got the best view of what we're doing here.\n\nIt's also exciting to be here with two weeks left because this is the most consequential election of our lifetime, and to see the energy and enthusiasm that this crowd displayed - I saw it yesterday in North Carolina, I saw it the day before in Ohio, it really does demonstrate that Americans are really looking at what's at stake and are coming to the conclusion that we all have to be involved in the remaining days of the campaign. And that everyone needs to turn out to vote.\n\nIn New Hampshire, you have a lot of reasons to vote - you've got great candidates for Congress, Annie Kuster and Carol Shea Porter, who deserve your support, and you've got a great candidate for governor, Colin Van Ostern, thank you!\n\nI know that Maggie, and Elizabeth and I have been out here giving the full dose, but I hope that you will know what is at stake in the governor's race, and in sending these two extraordinary women to the House, and boy, it is exciting to be here with Maggie and Elizabeth because they are people who fight for you every single day. I know these women, and it is a privilege to be on this stage with them.\n\nNow, Elizabeth Warren has a track record of making it her mission to stand up against Wall Street. And she is going to make sure that Wall Street never wrecks Main Street again!\n\nBut you may not know that she was the person behind setting up the agency that protects consumers. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and it was set up to stand against and to do something about the kinds of fraud and abuse we've seen from Wells Fargo. And they are on the front lines of returning billions of dollars to Americans who have been cheated and defrauded by big companies, by banks and others.\n\nIn fact, I think it is fair to say some of the best TV that you can see is on C-SPAN when Elizabeth is going after a bank executive or regulator. She is refusing - refusing to let them off the hook, and she is not just speaking for herself, is she? She is speaking for every single American who is frustrated and fed up. And I am so looking forward to working with her to rewrite the rules of our economy to make sure we both grow it and make it fairer for every single person working hard here in America.\n\nI know we are up here without our phones so we cannot check tweets but - I kind of expect if Donald heard what she just said, he is tweeting away. She gets under his thin skin like nobody else. Whether she is calling him out of his mysterious tax returns, she exposes him for what he is - temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be president of the United States. And Maggie is going to be a great United States senator for New Hampshire. You do not have to take my word or Elizabeth's word. Look at what she has already done. Under Maggie's leadership, New Hampshire has the lowest unemployment rate in the entire country.\n\nDuring her governorship, it was ranked as the best state in the country for business, and she has done it the New Hampshire way. She has brought people together, Democrats and Republicans, and Independents, and I think she has the biggest legislature, probably in the world, that she has to deal with. So she has really honed her skills - listening and trying to work with people, and she has taken issues that do keep families up at night. From the sky rocketing costs of college and prescription drugs , to helping students to figure out ways to afford to get their education to helping those suffering from addiction or mental health, to raising wages for hard working families. What I love about Maggie is that she is independent, she knows how to find common ground, and how to stand her ground. And that is exactly the kind of leader we need in the United States Senate.\n\nBecause we've got to break through the gridlock and dysfunction that has unfortunately marred Washington. We have to get back to listening respectfully. We can disagree without being disagreeable. And that is why we need leaders like Maggie, and unlike her opponent, she has never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump.\n\nShe knows he should not be a role model for our kids or anybody else for that matter. So I hope in these next 14 days, you do everything you can to support her. And I want to say a word about Colin, who I have also known for a number of years now. And Maggie is leaving some big shoes. She does not look like it, but she is, she is leaving some big shoes to fill as governor. Colin is the person for that job. You know as a member of Executive Council, and I remember this because it took a lot of guts.\n\nHe helped lead the fight for funding Planned Parenthood in New Hampshire. Against his opponent by the way, and he has showed that he will stand up for women's health 100 percent of the time, not just when it is politically convenient. He also worked with Maggie to cross party lines to help expand Medicaid to more than 50,000 granted stators.\n\nAnd Colin wants to do more to invest clean energy like wind and solar to hold down energy costs to create more good jobs here in New Hampshire and to protect the beautiful environment of this state. And he will fight to put into action the promise of higher education within reach for more families. So please during these next days, make sure you're doing everything you can for Colin, for Carol, and for Annie.\n\nNow did anybody see the last debate? I stood next to Donald Trump in three debates for four and a half hours proving once again, I have the stamina to be president. I've tried to use the time I had in all three to talk about what people talk to me about, starting here in New Hampshire and going across the country, because I take it really seriously.\n\nI think that the problems that keep you up tonight, that stand in the way of your getting ahead and staying ahead, of providing the best opportunity of a good middle class job with a rising income for you and your kids, those are the problems that someone running for president should actually listen to, pay attention to and come up with solutions for.\n\nSo, you know, I do have a lot of plans, I do. And I get criticized for having so many plans. Tim Kaine and I have actually written a book - oh, there's one copy right there! It's called - oh, another copy! It's called 'Stronger Together,' and we lay out all of our plans for what we want to do if we're so honored as to be president and vice president. And, you know, I do have this old-fashioned idea that if I'm here asking for your vote to be your president, I should tell you what I'm going to do, and maybe, as I said yesterday in North Carolina, maybe it's a bit of a women's thing because we make lists. We do, we make lists and we try to write down what we're supposed to do and then cross them off as we go through the day and the week. And so, I want you think about our plans are as our lists - our lists as a country.\n\nWe are going to get our economy working for everybody, not just those at the top. We are going to make college affordable. We are going to lower prescription drug costs, and we're going to do everything we can to keep faith with what we have said we're going to do. What a novel idea! We're actually going to try to deliver results for you.\n\nBut I got to tell you. During that debate, Donald said something. Well, he said a lot of things that were troubling, but he said something truly horrifying. He became the first person running for president - Republican or Democrat - who refused to say that he would respect the results of this election. Now, that is a direct threat to our democracy. I'm not going to try to call it anything else because that's what it is. All this talk about the election being rigged, trying to stir up people who are supporting him at his rallies, that is a direct threat to our democracy. And I got to tell you - as your secretary of state, I went to 112 countries and I went to countries where people were jailed for being political opponents, where they were exiled, where they were killed. I take this really seriously.\n\nAnd for me, the peaceful transfer of power is one of the things that makes our country great - something that - something we can't lose, something we shouldn't even doubt. We cannot give in to cynicism, and I don't think we are. I'll tell you what's exciting to me is across this country, at the very moment Donald Trump is making this unprecedented attack on our fundamental values, our institutions, millions of people are standing up for democracy, registering, volunteering, voting early.\n\nSo when you get a little discouraged or you get frustrated by what you see in this campaign, think of this: we have just reached a historic milestone. More than 200 million Americans are now registered to vote. And most exciting, that includes more than 50 million young people, the biggest number ever. Now you only see numbers like this when people are standing up for what they believe in and I'm proud to see Americans coming together - Democrats, Republicans and Independents - to reject hate and division. And we're seeing that in New Hampshire, too.\n\nWe are more than our disagreements, we Americans. There is so much more that unites us than divides us. I'm proud to have the support of more than 150 Republican leaders in this state who put country before party. But this energy we're seeing is not just because of what we're against, as important as that is, it's because what we're for. It's about fighting for a future where everyone counts, where everyone has a place, and no one is left out or left behind.\n\nBecause to me, and I hope to you as well, this is about more than winning an election, it's about the kind of country we want for our kids and our grandkids. That's what this has to be about. It's about the lessons we want to pass on to our sons and our daughters. You know, we believe we should honor the men and women who fight for our country and that America is safer when we work with our allies to lead the world with strength and intelligence. Yet my opponent attacked a grieving Gold Star family whose son died in Iraq. He has no plan to defeat ISIS. And just last night he tweeted that the new effort underway to push the terrorists out of the key city of Mosul is already, and I quote, 'a total disaster.' And that our country is, quote, 'looking so dumb.' Imagine, imagine, this is a guy who says he knows more about ISIS than the generals. I don't think so. He's basically declaring defeat before the battle has even started. He's proving to the world what it means to have an unqualified commander in chief. It's not only wrong, it's dangerous, and it needs to be repudiated on November the 8th here in New Hampshire and across America.\n\nBut just in case you think that this is new for Donald, it shouldn't surprise you or anybody else, and I'll tell you why. He has been denigrating America for decades. It started before he campaigned against me. It started before President Obama took office. In fact, back in 1987, he spent $100,000 on an ad in The New York Times criticizing President Reagan. He said, and I quote, 'The world is laughing at America.' Does that sound familiar? This is someone who roots for failure and takes glee in mocking our country no matter who our president is. Now that may be who Donald Trump is, but this election is about who we are. And I want us - I want us to remember, America is great because America is good, right? And as our wonderful First Lady Michelle Obama said right here in New Hampshire, 'When they go, we go high.'\n\nThis election poses a very clear choice on the economy. When the middle class thrives, America thrives. As Elizabeth said, she is a perfect example of how that works in America. So am I. So are every one of you here. That's what I want for every single person, especially young person, in America. With your help, we're going to not only have Elizabeth back in the Senate, but send Maggie, send Carol, send Annie and then make the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II.\n\nWhat does that mean? That means jobs in infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our mass transit, our water systems. There is a lot of great work to be done here. And guess what? Those are jobs that can't be exported. They've got to be done, right here in New Hampshire and across America. I want us to invest in advanced manufacturing, and there are, I know, a lot of skeptics about that. They say, 'Well, we can't compete in manufacturing anymore.' Well, I'll tell you what. I don't want us competing with low wage jobs. I want us competing for the high wage jobs. Germany is a major exporter of advanced manufacturing products. I want to compete with Germany and countries like that, precision, machining, 3D printing.\n\nI want us to invest more in technology, innovation and research and yes, in clean energy, because we're going to make America the clean energy superpower of the 21st century. I think we can deploy a half a billion more solar panels within the first four years and enough clean energy to power every home by the end of 10 years. That's what I want people to be working on and thinking about and striving to achieve.\n\nAnd I am really excited about what we can do to make sure every young American is prepared. I want to start in the early years of life in early education, universal pre-K. I want kids to be prepared to succeed. Because we are in a competition, and you know what? I want us to step up and compete and win. And I want our schools - I want kids to have good teachers and good schools in every zip code, and I want to be a good partner with our teachers and our educators here in New Hampshire. And I want to bring back technical education to high school. I think we really - we really shut the door on too many young people who could've gotten skills that would've given them the chance to get ahead.\n\nAnd working with our community colleges, we need to make sure that every young person and every person coming back to upgrade or change skills can go to a community college. And yes, we are going to make four-year college affordable. Just this week, a new report came out showing that New Hampshire students have very high levels of debt, and I know Maggie has been fighting that. And she's had a moratorium, and she's done what she could at the state level. But we got to work together at the national level to make this happen for students in New Hampshire, families in New Hampshire.\n\nSo after our primary was over - and you know what, I was really proud - I was really proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran. And it was a campaign - it was a campaign about ideas, not insults. And that's what campaigns should be about. And after it was over, Bernie and I got together. We put our heads together. And we came up with a plan to make public colleges and universities tuition free for any families making less than $125,000 a year. And if you make more than that, it will be debt free. In other words, pay what you can, but let's not have kids and families going into debt to get an education. This should be an investment that we make on behalf of them and our country's future. And no matter where you go, to a great school like this, or anywhere else, we will help you pay down your student debt. We will make is easier, because we a re going to make it as a percentage of you income, so you will never be on the hook for more than you can afford. And if your interested to see how much you and your family can save, you can actually go to hillaryclinton.com\/calculator to see how much you can save under this plan that we are proposing.\n\nNow, I think in addition to growing the economy, we need to do a lot more on small business. Two-thirds of new jobs will come from small business so we are going to be just focused on how we are going to be able to start and grow your small business. And then we do have to make the economy fairer, and that starts with raising the national minimum wage, because if you work full time, I am talking about full time workers, you should not still be in poverty at the end. Work should provide a ladder of opportunity for people willing to work for it to climb. Right?\n\nWe are going to guarantee equal pay, we are going to make affordable child care so nobody pays more than 10 percent of your income for childcare. We are going to work for paid family leave. Because this is the way families are today. We are not living in the 1950s. Families are under new stresses and strains, and I meet so many who are really just at the edge. They are making all they can make. One parent working full-time, two parents working full-time, sometimes part-time on top of full-time.\n\nThe other day, Tim Kaine and I were in Pittsburgh. There was a long line of people, big overflow, which we couldn't get into the main room where we were. So, Tim was talking to the families there, and there was a woman holding her three-year-old child, a daughter, I think. Tim was shaking hands, and the woman looked and she said, 'I came here hoping that I could tell you or Secretary Clinton that I had my baby three years ago, and the day after, I had my baby, I was fired because I called and ask if I could have a few weeks because it had been a difficult pregnancy. But my baby was fine but not all that she needed to be. I got fired.' And Tim came in, and he is such a wonderful man. What a fine human being. And he said, 'To be there are the reasons everyday why I get so motivated in this election, and I just have another reason.' He told me that story. I think your president should care about that. I think your president should wake up everyday thinking, 'Okay, how do I help empower the most people to make the most out of their own lives, how to break down the barriers that give you the chance to go as far as your hard work and talent will take you?' Sometimes people say, 'How are you going to get all this done?' I have proposed plans that do not add a penny to the debt because I see some of my long time friends who back in the 1992 campaign - where my husband ended up, we had a balance budget and a surplus, and actually, we were on the way to paying down the national debt, but here is what happened.\n\nWhat happened is trickle-down economics came back. So here is what I am going to do. We are going to ask the wealthy to finally pay their fair share. We are going to - we are going to close the loopholes, we are going to end the fact that millionaires can pay a lower tax rate than a nurse or a teacher or a police officer. We are going to make big banks pay for the risks they pose to our economy because Elizabeth is absolutely right. No - no bank is too big to fail, and no one should be above the law, and we are going to enforce that and contrast that with Donald Trump. He believes that if you give trillions and that is trillions with a 't' in tax cuts to the wealthy millionaires and billionaires and corporations, and everything will work out.\n\nWell, it will for him. That is trickle down economics on steroids. And he would wipe away the tough new rules that President Obama imposed on Wall Street. He would eliminate the Consumer Protection Financial Bureau that Elizabeth did so much to create. And you know that was bad enough, but then in the debates, we learned he hasn't paid any income tax for years. So he hasn't paid a penny to support our military, our veterans, Pell grants for kids to get an education, health or anything else. And his explanation was he lost a billion dollars in a year. Now, I've pondered this. I've really pondered this. He actually said it made him smart not to pay income taxes, but how smart are you to lose a billion dollars in a year?\n\nHas anyone here been to a casino? He lost a billion dollars running casinos. Who does that? I've never heard of anybody. So, we've got to make it clear that Donald is not on the side of America workers or American families. For all of his talk about putting America first, he makes his products in at least 12 other countries. He stiffs small businesses, mom and pop contractors who work for him. My dad was a small business owner. He worked really hard. I'm just glad he never got a contract from Donald Trump because it was hard work, and people who do that work should be rewarded, not taken advantage of.\n\nSo we know a lot about how Donald Trump works, and today, today, we heard yet another story. It's about a maintenance worker at one of his golf courses. This maintenance courses told his co-workers he was gay, and they started harassing him. They used anti-gay slurs to his face, they threw rocks and golf balls at him, his supervisor saw it and did nothing, and it got so bad, he wound up in the hospital. Finally, he went to the police for help. He couldn't go back to work because he was too scared for his safety, and then he was fired by Trump's golf club. Now, this is a heart-wrenching story on a lot of levels. For starters, it's a painful reminder of the harassment, violence, and discrimination that too many LGBT Americans still face every day. And it is deeply disturbing that instead of stepping in to stop the tormentors, Trump's golf club turned on the victim for coming forward. If that's how Donald Trump runs his business, what does that say about how he would run our country?\n\nSo my friends, there are lots of reasons, so many, to take this election seriously. But here's what I want you to know: of course, I want you to vote for all of us, but more than that, I want you to vote for yourselves, and for your families, and for your hope for our future together. Because if you believe women and girls should be treated with dignity and respect and women should be able to make our own health care decisions, and marriage equality should be protected, and that we have to take on the epidemic of substance abuse, disorders, and addiction. If you believe in a foreign policy where we work with our allies, not insult them, and achieve common goals towards peace and prosperity, then you have to vote. All of these issues are on the ballot this November, and I believe with all of my heart, that we will after this election, get together to help heal the divides that have sprung up and are so painful among us.\n\nSo please register and vote on the same day. Go to iwillvote.com to confirm your polling place. Come help us these last two weeks. Go to hillaryclinton.com, sign up to volunteer, take out your phone, text JOIN J-O-I-N to 47246 and get everybody you know to come out and vote. I think this election is going to turn on who is motivated to vote so we need each and every one of you to do everything you can to make it clear to everybody you know that our future is at stake. If you ought to be part of a positive, optimistic, confident, unifying future, please come out to vote on November 8th here in New Hampshire, and prove once and for all that love trumps hate.\n\nThank you all!\u0000","82":"Thank you. Thank you very much.  Thank you very much. So amazing. Rudy just left. He just said, \"I don't believe this. This is unbelievable.\" Nobody believes it.\nThe crowds we're getting -- I'm the messenger, but I'll tell you what, the message is the right message. We're tired of incompetence. We're tired of not taking care of our military. We're tired of not taking care of our vets, who are being taken care of very poorly.\n\nWe're tired of so many different things. And this is what happens. So, our mayor, my friend, Rudy Giuliani just walks, I'm telling you, he said, \"I don't believe this. This is incredible.\"\n\nAnd what he hasn't seen, and your governor, by the way, who's a great guy.\n\nAnd he's now seeing it, they're walking outside because there are thousands of people outside that can't get in. I said, \"Rudy, you think this is bad, go take a look outside.\"\n\nSo I just want to thank Pat and Rudy and I want to thank everybody for being here. And we are going to have a good time. We love North Carolina. We love North Carolina \n\nWe did really well in the primaries if you remember, and I hear we are doing really well now. We have to win. That November 8 day is so important.\n\nYou know, I bring things up like the judges right? Supreme Court Justices, we have to get - you know, you could have as many as four? I guess it's a scenario where this president could pick five Supreme Court Justices.\n\nAnd if you pick two that are left, left, left, it's going to be a disaster for our country. Your Second Amendment, the National Rifle Association endorsed and they endorsed me early, a long time ago. And they're great people, Wayne and Chris, they are great people. \n\nBut if you - if you do something with these - I'll tell you what, Justices right now, you lost a great one with Scalia. We want to replace with Justices very much like Justice Scalia and that's going to happen. It is so important.\n\nSo if for no other reason, I mean it's such an important - it's one of the most important elections for a lot of reasons, not just that but for a lot of reasons. But that's so obviously, because for whatever reason, they say this could be the presidency. This next four years is where you will pick more Supreme Court Justices than anybody has every had the opportunity to do. Believe me, I'll make you very proud of those Justices everyday. \n\nSo we had an incident a few days ago with the $400 million - all cash, right -- $400 million in all cash, anybody know what that looks like? That's a lot of cash. That's a lot of case.\n\nAnd honestly, it's so sad. Think of it, going to Iran, a terrorist state. Now I happen to think they have plenty of money, we've given then $150 billion, so the $400 million is just, you know - I happen to think it goes into their accounts in Switzerland personally.\n\nNow, a lot of people say, \"no, no, it's used for terror,\" and they use it for terror because it's the number one terror funder - not even close. But I also think that when you have $400 million in cash, different denominations, do you see the size of this? I guess they did release the pictures after all. They released pictures.\n\nAnd interesting I'll tell you, I sort of think it goes into bank accounts, right? You know, I sort of think they take it, they probably use some for this, some for that. You can do a lot of things.\n\nAnd Obama said that he did it because we don't have a working account with Iran. Do you believe that? How long does it take to set up an account? Right? You don't have a working account, you set up an account, right?\n\nYou set up an account and it takes about - look, what's going on in this country - folks, folks, what's going on in this country is insane. And we have people running our country that don't know what they're doing, they're grossly incompetent, and it's time. We have to make change, real change. Not Obama change, we have to make change.\n\nWhether it's Bergdahl, we get Bergdahl who was a traitor, and they get five of the greatest killers that they've wanted for eight years. We get Bergdahl -- I call it the five for one trade. For the Iran deal, where we get nothing, we get nothing.\n\nThey get ultimately, they have the path, beautiful path, they'll get way, way earlier than that. They'll get nuclear weapons, so if you get Trump you're going to see a lot of changes to that deal. That'll happen fast. \n\nYou're going to see some big changes and what I really -- I mean, I saw where President Obama said that the $400 million in cash was not, had nothing to do with the release of the hostages, right? It really doesn't work, does it? Does it? I mean, remember Obamacare, \"you're going to keep your doctor, you're going to keep your plan, over and over again, you're going to keep your doctor.\" It was a lie.\n\nAnd in fact, if he didn't make the lie, he would have never gotten it approved because most Democrats, many of the Democrats didn't want to do it. It was only that, that got them to sign it and to approve it. And it was a lie.\n\nAnd the $400 million, and from what the rumor is and from what the reports are, the hostages couldn't leave the airport until this other plane arrived. They don't know why, but I think we all have a pretty good reason why. It was all a big lie, it was all a big lie.\n\nAnd it's so sad to see, and let me tell you, Hillary Clinton is going to be four more years of Obama, but maybe worse. Maybe worse. There'll be four more years. Four more years of ISIS, four more years of high taxes. You know yesterday I had a -- at a big event, really. It turned out to be a very big event in Detroit \n\nGood event, very good. And we got wonderful reviews and a lot of good comments. But the thing I'm doing, I'm cutting taxes big league. Especially for the middle class and especially for businesses. Because businesses are dying and that means small businesses, businesses period. \n\nBusinesses are leaving our country like they've never left before. They're going all over. They're going to Mexico, that I can tell you. Mexico is like the eighth wonder of the world. You know I've been telling a story, a friend of mine, good friend of mine, good guy. He builds plants, he builds plants for cars, for computers, you know where they make them. Massive plants. And I said to him, how are you doing?\n\nAnd he's worked in North Carolina, by the way. I said to him, how are you doing? He said phenomenal. He's like, \"I think the biggest in the world at this -\" that's what he does. Great guy. I said how's it all going? He said, 'you've got to see Mexico, Donald. It's the eighth wonder of the world. What we're building there is like, never has been built. We've never seen anything like it\".\n\nAnd I said, how are we doing in the United States? I'm more interested in that, OK? It's OK I guess. Right? You know, America first, folks. America first. America. \n\nRight, America first. \n\nAmerica first. We get a little tired of these deals where they actually put, and you know why, because of lobbyists and special interests and people representing and people wanting it to happen. It's just not that they want other countries to benefit over us. There are reasons for it and you know, when I raise money, and I'm putting up a lot of money for my own campaign, I'm funding me.\n\nAnd I'm raising for the Republican party. And we're getting a lot of money from the small donors.\n\nRemember two months ago? Well, I hadn't started; I wanted to make sure I get the nomination before I start, right?\n\nLet me get the nomination, please. And then I took a lot of heat from the press, the world's most dishonest people, by the way.  Terrible.  Terrible. \n\nThose cameras will not move and show how many people are in this auditorium. Those cameras -- those cameras are not going on the move unless we have a protester, is there a protester up there in the quota? Any protesters? \n\nIf we had a protester that's the only time they move because they're showing something that in their mind is a bad thing, so then they move. But I like that, I've always liked my protesters because the cameras show these massive crowds and people say wow, was that a big crowd.\n\nYou know, I go home to my wife, I say how's it going? She says darling, your speech was very good, were there many people there? I say yeah, about 7,000. That's a small group.\n\nIts only confined -- I mean you had to see outside. I felt so badly -- I came up -- I came up -- thank you and I love you too. Who said that? Who said that, huh? \n\nThank you, thank you. But I came up with Rudy from New York and we're driving up and we're going block after block after block the line. And I said are those people going to be able to get in?\n\nThey said the place is already full. And Rudy just said man; I've never seen anything like that. Maybe a couple of days before an election, but this is what's happening. Because of the fact we have a movement going, folks.\n\nBecause people are so tired of them. \n\nThey're so tired of them. \n\nSo -- and by the way -- and by the way, voter ID, watch with that. Watch with voter ID, why aren't we having voter ID? In other words, I wanna vote, here's my identification, I wanna vote, as opposed to somebody coming up and voting 15 times for Hillary. \n\nWell -- and I will not tell you to vote 15 times. I will not tell you to do that, OK? \n\nYou won't vote 15 times. But people will, they'll vote many times and how that could've happened , it's unbelievable. And the governor just told me that they're going before the United States Supreme Court Justice Roberts and maybe they can get a stay. Let's see what happens, OK? \n\nLet's see what happens. That's a very important thing. But I wrote a few things down and to me, so important -- yes, darling thank you. \n\nUnstable Hillary lacks the judgment, now; Bernie Sanders said she lacks judgment, right? And nobody said anything about it, no problem. He said you lack judgment. And -- during one of the debates, nobody said, it was fine.\n\nWhen I say it they say that's terrible the way you talk. \n\nShe does, she lacks judgment, she lacks temperament and I'm the one that used unfit many, many months ago. And now they've turned it around, use it on me, unfit? I'm unfit? That's -- that's a first. But she lacks the temperament and the moral character to lead this country, its very simple.\n\nShe really does. She's a dangerous person who doesn't tell the truth which has been proven very loudly.\n\nI've never seen a -- I don't think we've ever had greater proof of that, of anybody. \n\nAnd she has disregarded the lives of Americans -- you see what's happening -- with what she has done with her server? And you know why she did that.\n\nSo, I just look at this, and I said that if she gets elected, she will cause the destruction of this country from within. Remember that. Remember that. \n\nShe will -- she will allow people into our country that will do damage, they will do damage, folks. You look at what's going on in the world -- look at France; take a good look at France. I have friends that go to France. They used to love France.\n\nThey say, no thank you. They don't expect to be going back anytime for a long time.\n\nI have one friend, I said, how was your trip this year to France? He said, France isn't France anymore. We're not going. And so many people are saying that.\n\nLook at what's going on with Germany. Look at what's happening with Germany. Look at the crime; look at the problems. We have enough problems in our country right now. We don't need additional problems, folks. We don't need additional problems. \n\nAnd for all we know, this could be the great Trojan Horse. This could be. We don't know who these people are.\n\nNow, they're coming in through Obama. And I looked at a chart yesterday, and it's like for years, it's sort of like this, a little uptick. And the last number or period of time, it's like, \"Wah, wah, wah, wah.\" There -- I have never seen anything like it.\n\nThey're letting them in, and again, you can't vet them. You don't know where they come from. We don't know -- look at the damage that two people in San Bernardino, probably radicalized the guy -- the woman coming in. Look at the damage in Orlando. Look at the damage that was done in Orlando by one wack job, one sick wack job. And you know what he was screaming? He's screaming what they all scream.\n\nAnd we have to get smart, folks. We don't need the problems -- and we've already got those problems, just so you understand. Because they're coming into the country, they're being put where nobody even knows where they are.\n\nIt's like, if I were the enemy, I would say, I can't believe they're that stupid. They're taking my people and they're putting them all over the place, because you have great military right here.\n\nAnd our military...\n\nOur military cannot be beaten. But you know what could happen? When we don't know where they are, where they're coming, you've them all over the place.\n\nAnd folks, it's some. You don't need many; you don't need many. One person in Orlando. Two people -- look at in France, 130. Now, they have the strictest gun laws anywhere in the world, France, Paris. One hundred and thirty people killed, 130.\n\nAnd I've said 100 times, if this man or if this woman, or if that woman or man had a gun in Paris or in San Bernardino and the bullets were flying in the other direction, would have been a whole different story, folks.\n\nWould have been a whole different. \n\nFor those -- for those foolish people that say Second Amendment, would have been a whole different -- and I'd go a step further. If these people, bad people, bad, sick, sick, sick people.\n\nIf these people knew there were guns in the good guys hands, right, they probably wouldn't have gone in in the first place, all right? All right? Gun free -- what do you think of these gun- free zones?\n\nDo you know what a gun-free zone is? That's like -- they study where the gun-free zones -- if they would have known you had guns, if they would have known that they were going to be shot at from the other side, it would have been a whole different story. Maybe it wouldn't have even happened in the first place.\n\nSo they better not come here. They better not. They better not. \n\nSo recently a book came out a couple of weeks ago. A Secret Service agent made a statement because she said the other day she short-circuited. Hey, could you imagine if I said that \"I short circuited\"? \n\nThey would be calling for my execution, -- electric chair. They'd bring back the electric chair. It would be a whole different ball game if I said it, believe me. But the Secret Service agent said, \"She simply lacks the integrity and temperament to serve in the office,\" right?\n\n\"From the bottom of my soul,\" he said, \"I know this to be true. Her leadership style, which is volcanic and impulsive, and she makes bad decisions. OK? Hey, you know, it's one thing to make bad decisions. It's another thing to be wacky and make bad decisions. \n\nShe is disdainful of the rules set for everyone else and she hasn't changed a bit. This is -- that was the good thing. I couldn't say the bad things. It was too much. Nobody would even -- nobody would even believe it. You've got to see this book. Nobody would believe because it's so terrible, so terrible.\n\nAnd she comes across like this woman -- nice, easy -- but she's not. And -- and she's -- listen -- she's not a leader, not a leader. And she is a liar. \n\nHey, hey -- 33,000 e-mails are gone. OK? 33,000 e-mails are gone. They're gone. How do you get rid of 33,000 e-mails? Who sends 33,000 e-mails? I mean, 33 -- do you know how many that is? I think that's like 24 hours a day reading them or sending them, but it wouldn't matter. For years, 33,000 e-mails are missing.\n\nAnd she's so guilty. She's so guilty. \n\nI think it's a tremendous blot in our country. I really mean that. I think what happened over the last two weeks with respect to her, especially in light of the fact that General Petraeus and many others have suffered unbelievable consequences. I think it's a tremendous blot on our country, a tremendous blot. Just remember that.\n\nBut I just looked at this -- the economic failures of Obama and Clinton, et cetera. Obama-Clinton economic policies have produced 1.2 percent economic growth, the weakest so-called recovery since the Great Depression. Now, this is, like, unbelievable -- 1.2.\n\nDo you know China goes to 7 percent or 8 percent, it's like a national catastrophe. Now, what they do is they cut their currency.\n\nThey devalue their currency, and big league, and then all of our businesses continue to be drained out of the United States. Our money, our jobs. They make our product, they sell our product to us. No tax, no nothing, you devalue -- see devaluing is sort of cheating.\n\nYou know, it's sort of like cheating. Now I have great relationships with China. I've done great business with China, I've done really well with China. I have these tenants, I sell condos, I own the Bank of America building in San Francisco with a group, a great group, thank you ma'am. \n\nGot to win -- got to win North Carolina. Thank you. \n\nThank you. But they -- it's cheating, it's really cheating. And when I look at these trade deals -- it's so sad -- where we lose $800 billion -- billion with B -- dollars a year on trade with China alone, it's $400 billion and $500 billion and $505 billion. This is year in and year out, it's actually amazing that our country keeps going. But what has happened is, we have people in the audience, in 18 years, they're making less money now than they made 18 years ago, in real wages, 18.\n\nAnd in many cases, they're working two and three jobs, OK? But they're making less money now than they made 18 years ago. And those stats come right out, real wages. They're working harder, they're getting older.\n\nSo in theory it's supposed to be the other way, you know you work and you're young, you don't care. Get a little older, it's like, oh by the way, how about me? I think I'm working harder too, if you want to know. \n\nI never worked this hard in my life. But I like it, I like it, I love it actually because I've met so many incredible people. You know I really got -- thank you -- I really got a tremendous understanding of this country. Because I'm going to places that I've heard about, I've known about, I'm stopping everywhere. And I see the carnage that NAFTA has caused, I see the carnage. It's been horrible. I see upstate New York, I see North Carolina, but I see every state. You look at New England. New England got really whacked. New England got hit.\n\nYou look at Ohio, what happened there, and still happening. By the way, this isn't like it's going to happen or it's all over, it's getting worse. You look at Ohio, you look at Michigan, what's going on with the car plants being built in Mexico, is unbelievable.\n\nAnd more and more, you know they're moving. We were just talking about the autoworkers yesterday. Where they've lost over 100,000 autoworkers in Michigan, the state of Michigan, which is our car capital and it's really not the car capital anymore. Mexico will become the new car capital of the world in a very short period of time. No, think of it.\n\nAnd that's only because we allow it to happen. And I like Mexico. And I respect the leaders of Mexico because they're much smarter, they're much street smarter, but they're much smarter and more cunning than our leaders. But you have to see what's going on. And one of the reasons I won Indiana was Bobby Knight, because he's the best, he's the greatest. \n\nBut one of the reasons is that Carrier Air Conditioning let 1,400 people go and they're building a plant in Mexico. And we're not going to let it happen . . .\n\nIt's a suicidal pact for our country. And you know I've watched for years.\n\nI was never a politician until 14 months ago. So I can't believe I'm saying I'm a politician. \n\nCan't believe it. \n\nBut -- but I've been watching for years and I've watched as -- as the government tries to keep businesses from leaving our country and going to other countries. And I've seen low interest loans, I've seen zero interest loans, I've seen all sorts of subsidies.\n\nI get it. That stuff's not gonna work, that's not gonna work. What's gonna work is -- as an example, Carrier moves to Mexico and you wish him a lot of luck, good luck, have a nice plant. I hope my friend bills it, right?\n\nAnd then you know what happens? When they make their air conditioners -- and then think they're gonna sell that air conditioner, people living in Indianapolis -- where they come from -- for a similar price.\n\nAnd they think they're gonna sell it there and have no repercussions? With me, they have repercussions, OK? \n\nWith me, they have repercussions. \n\nWith me, we inform them that if you move, you're gonna pay a 35 percent tax on every single air conditioner that pour across our now very secure borders. \n\nAnd two things are gonna happen, one of two things -- one of two things are gonna happen. Number one, if you get them in time, they're not moving. Throws it all off-balance, since they're all off-kilter. Number one they're not -- now, nobody -- people would say well, why doesn't anybody use this? Why doesn't anybody mention it?\n\nI'll tell you why. Because they're controlled by their lobbyists, they're politicians. And Carrier goes out or whoever it might be this -- I'm just using Carrier as an example. Its hundreds and thousands. Its thousands of company.\n\nAnd millions of jobs we're talking about. I was looking at numbers -- I'm not gonna repeat the numbers because they'll say I was wrong, it can't be that high, I couldn't believe it was that high. But it's thousands of companies and millions and millions of jobs.\n\nAnd you'd say why aren't -- like, why doesn't somebody else say what Trump is saying? So I'm controlled by myself because I'm putting up my money, OK? I'm putting up my money. \n\nBut...\n\nAlthough we raised, did you see $82 million last month, $82 million last month? \n\nAnd a lot of it -- a lot of the money was the small donations which Republicans never get. A lot of them -- I think it averaged $61 a hit, $61 can you imagine that? The total that we raised and in fact, in May I told you I was taking heat because they said Donald Trump didn't raise any money.\n\nAnd they told you why, right? I didn't raise it because I didn't know -- I gotta make sure I got the nomination. If I didn't get the nomination, I would've gone to Turnberry and played golf, OK? \n\nIn Scotland. But you know what? I got the nomination so now I had a start. And we raised $51 million in June, right? A lot of it in small donations and we raised $82 million in July.\n\nPeople are going, even the haters back there, the people that truly hate Trump -- they said, that's amazing. So we're doing all right. And people look, they want -- they wanna hear this message. Because this is a message this is an important message.\n\nBut when you say -- and when you hear what I just said -- you charge a tariff or a tax. And guess what? And people said why hasn't the -- why haven't the politicians, they're smart, why haven't they done it?\n\nBecause they're controlled by people that work for many of these companies and they're not gonna do it. Whether it's donors or whether its special interests or lobbyists they control because they want it to happen.\n\nAnd honestly, I think it's a total disgrace.\n\nI think it's a total disgrace for the millions of jobs, and for the thousands and thousands of companies that have left our country. If I were here to speak to every one of those companies for five minutes -- bye, bye.\n\nThey were so quiet. You know, I like the Hillary protesters. You know why? They're so nice and quiet. The Bernie protesters were brutal; they were tough. Right? The Hillary protesters had no spirit. Did you see that?\n\nShe starts screaming and the guy walks up, \"I'll go.\" \n\nThe Bernie ones were -- they had a lot more spirit. I think we're going to get a lot of Bernie voters, if you want to know the truth. Because they do understand that trade is killing us. Trade. \n\nSo, a few things, a few other facts I wrote, which I think are amazing. One is the 1.2 percent lowest in, you know, forget it. That's not a recovery. It's probably much -- don't forget, when they announced 1.2 percent, that means it's lower. And 1.2 is starting to set records.\n\nThe national debt -- so, we're up to almost $20 trillion -- $20 trillion! The national debt under Obama has doubled. Think of it, doubled. Might be, I think by the time he gets out, it's going to more than double, but again, we have to very accurate\n\nBecause I'll say -- they'll say, well, it hasn't quite doubled. Believe me, by the time he gets out it will have more than doubled.\n\nThe national debt has doubled. And you know the bad part about that? You think if the national debt has doubled, our infrastructure would be great, our country would be in great shape\n\nWe'd have beautiful roads, beautiful highways. You see where like 50 percent of the bridges are in danger in this country. And the roadways are a mess.\n\nI have a friend, he's in the trucking business. He said, you know, for years, he had no problem. Now he buys these big, beautiful trucks, and the wheels get wiped out because of the potholes on the highways and things that he never had. So, you think with all of that doubling of the national debt, you'd really think that we'd be in good shape from the infrastructure standpoint, right? We're not. We're in very bad shape.\n\nU.S. trade deficit, $800 -- almost $800 billion. Nearly 24 million Americans in their prime earning years are out of the labor force, right?\n\nIn the last seven years, another 14 million people have left the work force. Think of it. These are the real numbers, not the 5 percent nonsense.\n\nYou know, you look for a job, you can't find your job, you go home, you share, you go to your parents, you go to your friends, you do whatever. You gave up, and now you're considered -- statistically, you're considered employed.\n\nThose people are not employed; these are great people. And there are plenty of them in here.\n\nI mean, we have great people. We have the most loyal people. We have the smartest people. You know, so many of my people, they're so smart.\n\nThey like to say, well, Trump, I don't know if he's got this right -- let me tell you, we have the smartest people. We have the people that are the smartest, and the strongest, and the best and the hardest working. \n\nWe have the smartest people. We'll put I.Q.s among -- some of us, we couldn't say all of us, right -- against any I.Q.s that we -- we have to deal with, . . .\n\nIn the last seven years, 14 million. One in five American households do not have a single member in the workforce. Pretty bad.\n\nHomeownership -- this is one that is amazing to me -- today, homeownership is at its lowest rate in 51 years.\n\nSo you own homes, I mean it always used to be the dream to own a home, right? The American home.\n\nLowest that its been in so many years, 51 years. Nearly 12 million people and more Americans are dependent on food stamps and 2 million more Latino Americans live in poverty under Obama and Clinton -- under Obama; because Clinton's just gonna carry on.\n\nYou know, I don't know if you saw. I gave a massive tax decrease yesterday at regulations, we're gonna get rid of so many of them. But Clinton is gonna double your taxes; she's gonna double up your taxes.\n\nAnd she's trying to say well, I don't know like Trump's way -- she's gonna double up your taxes. You're gonna have massive tax increases is Clinton gets in. Enjoy -- enjoy it folks, if that happens.\n\nFifty eight percent of African American youth are not employed. How sad is that? American households are earning $4,000 less -- listen to this one, today -- than they were 16 years ago. Many workers are earning less than 1970 in real dollars.\n\nSo 1970 -- that's a long time ago, right? They're earning in real dollars less money. So under my plan, we're gonna create millions of new and really good paying jobs. You know, it's interesting because even the pro-Obama people say about the jobs that they're bad jobs.\n\nI've heard it from many of the people. They're trying to defend him. But they say they're bad jobs, they're not good jobs. The good jobs -- the good jobs have left. But we'll create millions of new good paying jobs but good jobs.\n\nThat's so important, that's so important. \n\nEveryone's taxes will go down. Hillary Clinton has supported tax increases on the middle class for her entire career. She's voted for higher taxes, 235 times in the Senate. That's all? I thought it was more than that, 235 times. I hope there's not a decimal point in there or so, 23.5 times.\n\nBut I don't think there is -- voted for higher taxes, 235 times in the Senate. Now, she's planning another job killing -- $1.3 trillion tax increase, that's what her tax increase is gonna be, folks. Like you're not paying enough, right?\n\nHer plan will tax many small business -- businesses who are already in deep trouble out of business. Then we have -- we will make -- and this is so important, this was an Ivanka Trump, OK? My daughter, so great. \n\nSo great. \n\nWe're gonna make childcare expenses tax deductible for working families. \n\nAnd just many, many other things. I mean, we're gonna make some unbelievable changes and it's -- it's so easy. Again, you know regulations -- I'm traveling all over and I'm meeting with business owners -- and beyond business owners, even people that work at the businesses, they're being laid off because of it.\n\nRegulations; if I told you -- and I'm so surprised, this is probably the biggest surprise -- if you have a small business and I said, you can have one or the other, a major tax cut like we're gonna -- you know, we're bringing it down to 15 percent from more than -- much more than double that.\n\nBut if I told you that you could have a massive tax decrease or really substantially -- but in a real way -- cut regulations -- a hundred percent of the people I talk to would take the regulation, if you could only have one or the other. It's amazing, its amazing\n\nAnd that surprised me. Surprised you too? \n\nSurprised him, too. \n\nA hundred percent. I mean, everybody -- businesses can't form anymore, the tax -- the regulatory burden is so incredible that you can't form businesses -- very hard -- and businesses that are in existence are being put out of existence for regulations that don't do anything. We want safety regulations, we want environmental regulations. We're not, you know, people that don't want these things. We have to have that.\n\nWe want clear air, we want clean water. We want clear water. But -- but...\n\nTo do that -- and there are certain things that you want to do, but to do that, you don't have to destroy our country and destroy our businesses. \n\nSo you know, I just wrote this down today. Hillary wants to raise taxes. It's a comparison. I want to lower them. Hillary wants to expand regulations, which she does big league. Can you believe that? I will reduce them very, very substantially. Could be as much as 70, 75 percent. \n\nHillary wants to shut down energy production. I want to expand it. \n\nLower electric -- lower electric bills, folks. Hillary wants to abolish -- essentially abolish the Second Amendment. By the way, and if she gets to pick... \n\nIf she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is. I don't know. But -- but I'll tell you what. That will be a horrible day. If -- if Hillary gets to put her judges -- right now, we're tied. You see what's going on.\n\nyou see what's going on? We tied because Scalia - this was not suppose to happen. Justice Scalia was going to be around for ten more years at least and this is what happens. That was a horrible thing.\n\nSo now look at it. So Hillary essentially wants to abolish the Second Amendment. Now, speaking to the NRA folks - who are great - when you - when you -- and I'll tell you, they endorsed me. \n\nThey endorsed me very early. My son's a member. I'm a member.\n\nIf you - we can add I think the National Rifle Association, we can add the Second Amendment to the Justices - they almost go - in a certain way, hand in hand. Now the Justices are going to do things that are so important and we have such great Justices, you saw my list of 11 that have been vetted and respected. \n\nAnd have gotten great. And they to a little equate - but if you don't do the right thing, either you're not going to have a Second Amendment or you're not going to have much of it left. And you're not going to be able to protect yourself, which you need\n\nYou know, when the bad guys burst into your house, they're not looking about into Second Amendments, and, do I have the right to do this? OK, the bad guys aren't going to be giving up their weapons\n\nBut the good people will say, \"oh, well, that's the law.\" No, no, not going to happen, we can't let it happen. We can't let it happen. \n\nHillary Clinton wants to have totally open borders where people flow into our country. \n\nWhere they flow into our country, and they take your jobs, and they do lots of things. And I want people to come into our country but they have to do it through a process, they have to do it legally, right? \n\nSo you have drugs pouring in. You have everything coming in.\n\nYou know, in New Hampshire, a great state, they have a tremendous heroin problem. I said to them, we will stop the drugs from pouring in to our country from the Southern border. They're going to stop. \n\nAnd by the way, we will build a wall. That's legal. \n\nWalls do work. Walls do work. \n\nNow here's one and you know -- I mean she doesn't look that way, but she is -- Hillary wants to invade foreign countries. That's what she does and look at the mess. So we've spent -- you know for two years, for three years, I've been saying we spent $2 trillion, right, in Iraq, more now, I guess. Somebody actually said to me the other day that they were talking about four or five trillion in the Middle East.\n\nAnd I'm going to get the accurate number. They don't know the accurate number, the truth is they have no idea. They have no idea what we're doing. We're sending equipment over, the enemies take it in. We sent over 2,300 Humvees that are totally armor plated. They got stolen by the enemy, 2,300. I thought they meant like two or 23.\n\nOr 230 was too much, 2,300 Humvees and they got stolen. They got taken by the enemy. You know, shot guns fired in the air, the ones we gave to the so-called allies, these great allies that we always pick, who end up being worse than the guys who we're trying to get out. \n\nSo, terrible. Hillary and President Obama refused to use the term radical Islamic terrorism. Big problem. Big problem. Hillary wants to release violent criminals and criminal offenders from prison, that's wonderful, enjoy yourselves. I want to work with our police. Our police are so incredible, they're not getting the respect they deserve. \n\nNot getting the respect they deserve. \n\nAnd we're going to, in our country, restore law and order. We have to, we have to restore law and order. \n\nAnd the police are going to be careful and they're going to be studied and they're going to be -- but we have to restore law and order. What happened in Dallas, where all of those people were shot down. Absolutely, absolutely for no reason. Viciously shot down, and so many others. I was with one of the police groups the other day. They're endorsing me.\n\nOf like, eight other states in the last short while where the same, smaller number, but the same thing was happening where police are being killed. We have to respect and cherish our police. \n\nSchool choice we want, common core we don't want. We've got to get rid of common core, bring educational...\n\nAnd folks, and we have to re-negotiate with NAFTA. And by the way, going back to the wall, Mexico is going to pay for the wall. That I can tell you. \n\nListen, you know these politicians, they don't know me. They don't understand me. And I am, I'm in a group of 50 people, these are real geniuses. These are 50 people that have been running our country forever and they said we can't support Donald Trump. The reason they can't, you know why, because I'm not going to hire these people, I don't want these people.\n\nTake a look. Take a look at what these people -- these are sort of like the people that have been involved with Washington, making decisions militarily on defense, on other things -- take a look what has happened in our country. Our military is depleted, our vets aren't taken care of.\n\nWe can't beat ISIS. Can you imagine General George Patton, who is right now spinning in his grave, the great General Douglas MacArthur -- can you imagine -- and I say, because we have so many military people, and this is such a military state and I love it. \n\nI love. But can you imagine them seeing that we can't beat these 25 or 30,000 people, we can't beat them? We're fighting a political correct war.\n\nIt's a political correct war. I mean, you know what's going on. You know what's going on. These are people that chop off heads. These are people that, in steel cages, drop steel cages into the waters and drowned large numbers of people.\n\nThese are people that buried people in the sand. We've got to knock them out.\n\nI was against the war in Iraq. We shouldn't have been to the war in Iraq. It destabilized the Middle East and I said that was going to happen. But we shouldn't have gotten out the way we got out.\n\nThe way we got out was insane. And Obama gave a date, and he -- and that's how ISIS happened, folks. Hence, the birth of ISIS. \n\nCongratulations, Hillary Clinton. Congratulate -- I mean, she -- she should get -- if I'm ISIS, I call her up and I give her the most valuable player award. OK? \n\nAnd I guarantee you with Libya, which was her baby, and all of the other mistakes she has made. Obama takes now, because obviously, for him, that's the better alternative, all right? But he has been an incompetent president. He has done a horrible job.  And I guarantee you that if he had it to it again -- and he would only say this to his wife -- but if he had it to do again, he would not have chosen Hillary Clinton to be his secretary of state, because she made so many horrible mistakes and cost so many lives.\n\nAnd I mean lives on both sides. I'm not just saying -- I mean lives on both sides. She's inept; she's inept.\n\nAnd to think that she is even allowed to run for the presidency of the United States, when she deleted and got rid of 33,000 e-mails is an embarrassment to our country, and it always will be, OK? It always will be. \n\nSo -- so, I want to thank all of you for being here. Look, I'm going to be around, and we're going to be coming to North Carolina a lot. Got to win it, very important \n\nBut -- the people are great. My daughter-in-law comes from North Carolina. I'm here all the time. \n\nBut -- but people -- the people are great. The military is great. We are going to make America great again. \n\nWe're going to start winning. We're going to put America first. We're going to make America safe again.\n\nBut never, ever forget, we are going to make America great again.\n\nThank you. Thank you, everybody. I'll be back soon. Thank you. God bless you.\u0000","83":"Thank you. It's great to be here today.\nIn particular, I want to thank Mr. Ron Packard and Ms. Deborah Mays for hosting me at their school.\n\nToday, we are going to discuss one of the most important issues in this campaign: school choice.\n\nBut before we do, I want to briefly discuss new revelations about Hillary Clinton's emails. According to the FBI report: \"The FBI did find that hostile foreign actors gained access to the personal email accounts of individuals with whom Clinton was in regular contact, and, in doing so, obtained emails sent to or received by Clinton on her personal account.\"\n\nRemember, Hillary Clinton was emailing about the drone program - among many other extremely sensitive matters.\n\nThis is yet more evidence that Hillary Clinton is unfit to be commander-in-chief. By the way, the whole country saw how unfit she was at the Townhall last night, where she refused to take accountability for her failed policies in the Middle East that have produced millions of refugees, unleashed the horror of radical Islamic terrorism, and made us less safe than ever before.\n\nThroughout it all, she put the entire country at risk in order to cover-up her pay-for-play scandals as Secretary of State. These include scandals like giving up our uranium to Russia, doing favors for UBS bank, and selling contracts to friends and family in Haiti.\n\nIt's all about hiding her criminal enterprise at the Clinton Foundation.\n\nAs part of her criminal cover-up, Hillary Clinton's staff digitally bleached her emails after receiving a Congressional Subpoena. Her staff also destroyed some of her 13 different phones with a hammer.\n\nThen, when she was interviewed by the FBI, she claimed she couldn't remember important events 39 times. She couldn't even remember whether she was trained on handling classified information. She even said she didn't know that the letter \"C\" stood for confidential classified information.\n\nAll the while, as Hillary and Bill raked in millions of dollars from special interests, the world fell apart. Hillary Clintons' policies produced ruin in Libya, Iraq, and Syria. She failed in Russia, in China, in North Korea.\n\nHer policies unleashed ISIS, spread terrorism, and put Iran on the path to nuclear weapons - not to mention the ransom payments.\n\nOn top of it all, Hillary Clinton is trigger-happy. She's raced to invade, intervene, and topple regimes. She believes in globalism, not Americanism.\n\nLast night, she even falsely said no American died in Libya. Then she also falsely said there's no ground troops in Iraq, even though we have 5,000 military personnel there right now.\n\nIraq is one of the biggest differences in this race. I opposed going in, and I opposed the reckless way Hillary Clinton took us out - letting ISIS fill the void.\n\nBut I was opposed to the war from the beginning.\n\nLong after Howard Stern, but three months before the Iraq war started, I said, in an interview with Neil Cavuto, that \"perhaps  shouldn't be doing it yet,\" and that \"the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the President is concerned.\"\n\nThen, On March 25th of 2003, just days after the war started, I was quoted as saying the war is \"a mess,\" yet more clear evidence that I had opposed the war from the start.\n\nIn July of 2003, I said that \"I would love to see New York City and some of the cities and some of the states get some of the money that`s going toward Iraq and other places, because you know, they really need and it they need it badly.\" I had a number of quotes to this effect.\n\nThen, in August of 2004, very early in the conflict, I made a detailed statement to Esquire magazine.\n\n\"Look at the war in Iraq and the mess that we're in. I would never have handled it that way. Does anybody really believe that Iraq is going to be a wonderful democracy where people are going to run down to the voting box and gently put in their ballot and the winner is happily going to step up to lead the country? C'mon. Two minutes after we leave, there's going to be a revolution, and the meanest, toughest, smartest, most vicious guy will take over.\n\nWhat was the purpose of the whole thing? Hundreds and hundreds of young people killed. And what about the people coming back with no arms and no legs? Not to mention the other side. All those Iraqi kids who've been blown to pieces. And it turns out that all of the reasons for the war were blatantly wrong. All this for nothing!\n\nI would have been tougher on terrorism. Bin Laden would have been caught long ago.\"\n\nHad I been in Congress at the time of the invasion, I would have cast a vote in opposition. For years, I have been a critic of the kind of reckless foreign invasions and interventions that have been the Hallmark of Hillary Clinton's failed career.\n\nHere is the bottom line: I was a private citizen. I had no access to the briefings that Hillary Clinton had. But in Iraq, my judgement was right and hers was wrong.\n\nHillary Clinton is always complaining about what's wrong, but she's been there for more than 30 years and has never done anything about it - all you have to do is look at New York State, when she was a Senator. All talk, but nothing happened.\n\nWe're on track to spend $6 trillion altogether on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nMeanwhile, massive portions of our country are in a state of disrepair.\n\nIt's time to rebuild America.\n\nToo many Americans living in our inner cities have not been included in the American Dream.\n\nWe are one nation, and when any part of our country hurts - our whole country hurts.\n\nMy goal as President will be to ensure that every child in this nation - African-American, Hispanic-American, all Americans - will be placed on the ladder of success: a great education, and a great job.\n\nThat ladder rests on a fundamental foundation: safety.\n\nIn order to help our children succeed, our first duty is to ensure that every kid in America can grow up in a safe community.\n\nYou can't have prosperity without security.\n\nThis is the new civil rights agenda of our time. The right to a safe community, a quality education, and a secure job.\n\nOur campaign represents the long-awaited chance to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a New American Future.\n\nThere is no failed policy more in need of urgent change than our government-run education monopoly.\n\nThe Democratic Party has trapped millions of African-American and Hispanic youth in failing government schools that deny them the opportunity to join the ladder of American success.\n\nIt is time to break-up that monopoly.\n\nI want every single inner city child in America who is today trapped in a failing school to have the freedom - the civil right - to attend the school of their choice. This includes private schools, traditional public schools, magnet schools and charter schools which must be included in any definition of school choice.\n\nOur government spends more than enough money to easily pay for this initiative - with billions left over. It's simply a matter of putting students first, not the education bureaucracy.\n\nLet's run through the numbers.\n\nAt the state and federal level, the United States spends more than $620 billion on K-12 education each year. That's an average of about $12,296 for every student enrolled in our elementary and secondary public schools.\n\nThe federal government pays for about 10 percent--$64 billion, to be precise--of the K-12 costs. That $64 billion makes up about half of the total spending of the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nThe other roughly $570 billion spent on K-12 education comes from the states.\n\nWe spend more per student than almost any other major country in the world. Yet, our students perform near the bottom of the pack for major large advanced countries.\n\nOur largest cities spend some of the largest amounts of money on public schools.\n\nNew York City spends $20,226 dollars per pupil.\n\nBaltimore spends $15,287 dollars per student.\n\nChicago spends $11,976 dollars per student, and in Los Angeles it is $10,602.\n\nJust imagine if each student in these school systems was given a scholarship for this amount of money - allowing them and their family to choose the public or private school of their choice.\n\nNot only would this empower families, but it would create a massive education market that is competitive and produces better outcomes.\n\nThese schools would then cater to the needs of the individual student and family - not the needs of the Teachers' Union. There is no more important job than a teacher, and teachers will benefit greatly from these reforms.\n\nThe current government monopoly, while great for the bureaucrats, has utterly failed too many students.\n\nAccording to the National Assessment of Education Progress, only 1 in 6 African-American students in the eighth grade are considered proficient in math and reading.\n\nFailing schools then contribute to failing economies.\n\nIn Los Angeles the official unemployment rate for African-American men is almost 20.7 percent. In Baltimore, it is 16.2 percent, 14.7 percent in Chicago and 10.9 percent in New York City.\n\nIn Los Angeles, 26 percent of African American women live in poverty. In Baltimore, the poverty rate for African Americans is 27 percent. In New York, over 31 percent of African Americans live in poverty.\n\nNationwide, nearly 40% of African-American children live in poverty - including 45% of children under the age of six.\n\nOur public schools are failing to put young Americans on a path to success.\n\nMeanwhile, we have all seen the tragic rise in crime in these communities - which remains one of the greatest barriers to fostering opportunity and success for America's children.\n\nViolent crime rose more than 20% in Los Angeles in 2015. Homicides in Baltimore increased by 63%. There have been nearly 3,000 victims of shootings in Chicago so far this year.\n\nGovernment is failing our citizens at every level.\n\nThat is why I am proposing a plan to provide school choice to every disadvantaged student in America.\n\nThat means parents will be able to send their kids to the desired public, private or religious school of their choice.\n\nHere is how it will work.\n\nRight now, about $1.9 billion is spent on fifty private school choice programs nationwide. These are opportunity scholarships, tax credits, and education savings accounts. This covers about 400,000 students in our country.\n\nAltogether, school choice is serving more than 3.4 million students nationwide.\n\nCharter schools, in particular, have demonstrated amazing gains and results in providing education to disadvantaged children and the success of these schools will be a top priority for my Administration.\n\nThey also produce competition that causes better outcomes for everyone.\n\nMy first budget will immediately add an additional federal investment of $20 billion towards school choice. This will be done by reprioritizing existing federal dollars.\n\nSpecifically, my plan will use $20 billion of existing federal dollars to establish a block grant for the 11 million school age kids living in poverty.\n\nWe will give states the option to allow these funds to follow the student to the public or private school they attend. Distribution of this grant will favor states that have private school choice and charter laws, encouraging them to participate.\n\nThis $20 billion will instantly extend choice to millions more students.\n\nA state like Ohio will benefit greatly from these new funds. Ohio is a leader in school choice. Ohio has 5 private school choice programs that serve over 30,000 students, and 384 charter schools serving 123,844 students.\n\nBut the $20 billion is only the beginning. As President, I will establish the national goal of providing school choice to every American child living in poverty.\n\nThat means that we want every disadvantaged child to be able to choose the local public, private, charter or magnet school that is best for them and their family.\n\nEach state will develop its own formula, but we want the dollars to follow the student.\n\n9 in 10 dollars spent on K-12 education is spent at the state and local level. To achieve this long-term goal, we will have to make this a shared national mission - to bring hope to every child in every city in this land.\n\nI will use the pulpit of the presidency to campaign for this in all 50 states, and I will call upon the American people to elect officials at the city, state and federal level who support school choice.\n\nMy Administration will partner with the leadership of any inner city in America - Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit - that is willing to run a pilot program to provide school choice to every child in that community. In Baltimore, for instance, that would mean more than $15,000 funds available per student.\n\nI am confident that the politicians will not be able to suppress the will of the people anymore.\n\nIf we can put a man on the moon, dig out the Panama Canal, and win two World Wars, then I have no doubt that we, as a nation, can provide school choice to every disadvantaged child in America.\n\nIf the states collectively contribute another $110 billion of their own education budgets toward school choice, on top of the $20 billion in federal dollars, that could provide $12,000 in school choice funds to every K-12 student who today lives in poverty.\n\nThe money will follow the student. That means the student will be able to attend the public, private, charter or magnet school of their choice - and each state will develop its own system that works best for them.\n\nAs your President, I will be the nation's biggest cheerleader for school choice. I understand many stale old politicians will resist. But it's time for our country to start thinking big once again. We spend too much time quibbling over the smallest words, when we should spend our time dreaming about the great adventures that lie ahead.\n\nI will also support merit-pay for teachers, so that we reward great teachers - instead of the failed tenure system that rewards bad teachers and punishes good ones.\n\nAt the same time, we have to ensure that jobs are waiting for our young kids when they graduate high school and college.\n\nMy policies will add millions of new jobs to our country, especially for our African-American and Hispanic communities.\n\nMy plan to lift restrictions on the production of American energy will not only make home energy bills cheaper, but it will add an estimated half a million jobs per year.\n\nBy reducing radical regulation and over-taxation, we can bring thousands of new companies into our poorest communities.\n\nCrucially, my trade reforms will create a manufacturing revival in America. We have a nearly $800 billion dollar annual trade deficit with the world - that's money coming straight out of states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Maine, and so many others. By ending foreign currency manipulation, product dumping, and other predatory trading practices, we will be able to open thousands of new plants and factories across America.\n\nThe future is filled with limitless possibilities for our nation, and exciting opportunities for our children.\n\nAll we have to do is cut our ties with the failed politics of the past. We've had a failed foreign policy. A failed education policy. A failed economic policy. And, underneath it all, a failed political system that rewards politicians for how many donors they have - or how many journalists they know - not how many Americans they help to live better lives.\n\nBut the failures of the past are about to end.\n\nThose failures end beginning on November 8th.\n\nWe will have One American Nation.\n\nWe will be One American People.\n\nWe are fighting to give every child, in every forgotten stretch of this country, the chance to live out their dreams in safety and peace.\n\nThat means a safe neighborhood, a quality education, and a secure high-paying job.\n\nThis is how we will rebuild our future.\n\nThis is how We Will Make America Great Again - For Everyone.\n\nThank you.\u0000","84":"Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Unbelievable. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. It's a great honor. Thank you. \nAmazing. Amazing. What great people.\n\nWe're going to bring back our jobs to Pennsylvania. We're going to bring back our jobs to the United States. \n\nGoing to bring back our jobs, folks. I've looked at the numbers and I see what's happening in Pennsylvania. I see what's happening all over our country.\n\nYou look at New York state, you look at New England, you look anywhere in the country where you want to go to, all over it's the same. Manufacturing way down, jobs way down. You go to other countries, they're taking our companies, they're taking our jobs.\n\nPeople are right now working harder than they've ever worked. Eighteen years ago they made more money in real wages, 18 years, think of it. Eighteen years ago many of the people in this incredibly big room, and thank you for being here, you know it's 93 degrees out. \n\nAnd they still have a lot of people trying to get in, I don't know if they can get them in. Should we let them in? Just let them in. \n\nBut 18 years ago, people were making more money in real wages than they make today. And today they're working two jobs, some people are working three jobs. So they're older, and they're working harder, and they're making less money, all right? A friend of mine, I've been telling this story over the last month because it's better than going to Wharton or better than going to Harvard and asking them to do a study, because you learn it in three minutes.\n\nBut let me just tell you. Right now, Mexico and other countries are building facilities, plants, the likes of which you've never seen. We're going to build the wall, don't worry, we're going to build the wall, we're going to build it, we're going to build it. \n\nBut a friend of mine, and actually a supporter, big supporter, great guy. He builds plants, that's what he does, he builds plants. He doesn't want to build apartments, he doesn't want to build office buildings, he wants to build plants. And he's just about the biggest there is. And I said how are things going? He said very well, how are you doing in the U.S.? Not good. How are you doing in Mexico?\n\nHe said Donald do you want to see, it's the eighth wonder of the world. They are building plants, the likes of which I've never seen. He's building some of the greatest plants, big--you look at Ford moving vast operations to Mexico. The plants. You look at--look at, take a look. By the way, millions of jobs, thousands of companies over the years, they've left us. And we have a few things. We have unemployment, we have empty plants, I saw up in New York state, I saw it in Pennsylvania, you were great to meet, you voted a big victory for Donald Trump, thank you. \n\nThat was a big victory. I mean I assumed I was going--if I don't win Pennsylvania--and by the way, I was talking to our great Congressman, and where is he? He's here some place, where is he? \n\nHe loves the people, and I have to say, of all of Pennsylvania he wants to see this state do well. Thank you. But just talking back to a few of my friends that live here, we have a few of the friends and we see what's happened with General Electric where they're cutting way back. Not going to happen. And you know why they're cutting back, it's one reason. Because we don't take care of our miners and we're not producing coal.\n\nAnd they don't need to make those big, big beautiful, you could call them locomotives I guess, right? Whatever the hell they are, they're big and they're powerful and they don't need them like they used to because we don't make our government work for us. They're not working for us. They're working for others, they're not working for us. So when General Electric goes out and you see the numbers, I see the numbers, and it's about coal, so I just left parts of Virginia and West Virginia, and the coal industry's decimated.\n\nThe miners are out of work, they're totally out of work. I mean there will be no such thing as coal in this country pretty soon. And we're talking clean coal, we're talking clean coal.\n\nSo I was with the miners, we have such tremendous support, West Virginia, the mining parts of Virginia. All over, Ohio, because Hillary Clinton made the statement not so long ago. A number of months she said, we're going to put the mines and miners out of business. All right? Going to put the mines and the miners - so \n\nSo, we're not going to let that happen. We're not going to let that happen and we're not going to let it happen in Pennsylvania because you know what? A lot of your miners have already lost their jobs, but you have a lot of other jobs that are very reliant on the mines. Like, as an example, General Electric. And what we're going to do, folks, is going to be so special. We're going to bring it back. We're going to bring back our jobs, we're going to bring back our companies. \n\nWhen a company wants to leave our country to go to another country and think they're going to make their product, and because our politicians are weak, stupid, taken care of by lobbyists, special interests--they're taken care of by lobbyists, they're taken care of by donors and special interests. That's what--you know, a friend of mine--very smart guy--said--I can't believe it. We're talking about a deal that took place about a month ago.\n\nHe said, I can't believe they could have gotten that through. I said, Why can't you believe it? Well, it's so bad for the country. I said, Yeah, but it's good for the politician because they're taken care of by their lobbyists and their donors and the special interests.\n\nSo even though you say we want, as an example, General Electric to produce more, if they don't want to or if for some reason one of the donors of crooked Hillary Clinton doesn't want that to happen, even though it's great for Erie, even though it's great you, even though it's great for the state of Pennsylvania, then it's not going to happen, folks. It's not going to happen.\n\nAnd by the way--and I have to tell you this. So when they think they're going to take our companies are rip them out of--as an example--this area or this state or any other state and go to Mexico and build massive new plants and employ people other than you, and you're going to lose your jobs or you're going to now get two part- time jobs that don't add up to half of what you used to make. That stuff isn't happening anymore. So here's what happens. They're going to build that plant. Now, if I were here five years ago and if President Obama put me and maybe secretary of keeping business in the United States--that's my title, secretary of keeping business in the United States. \n\nI mean, I like the sound of secretary of defense better. Oh, and by the way, we're going to build our military. We're going to be very strong. \n\nReally. And we're going to take care of our vets. We're going to take care of our vets, believe me. \n\nBut I like the sound--I like the sound of secretary of Defense. I like the sound of secretary of the Treasury. I like the sound of secretary of State. But I'll tell you, would I be good at keeping jobs over here. Would I be... \n\nI'll tell you this. I just have to say the Bernie Sanders protesters were much, much stronger. They had much more passion, I have to say. \n\nAll right. You know what's interesting? If I could speak to them for like five minutes--we want a strong military, we want to take care of our people, we want good education, we want good housing, we want good healthcare. What do we want? We're all in for the same thing. \n\nReally amazing. Really amazing. So I'll be your secretary of keeping companies in the United States, right? So, I would go to a company like Carrier Air Conditioner, which decided to leave Indianapolis, Indiana, and I would say here's the story.\n\nWe think it's wonderful that you're negotiating with Mexico. I'm sure you're going to have a wonderful plant, but here's what's going to happen. If you build that plant and you fire all of these people, 1400 people who were so great to me.\n\nIndiana, I won that in a landslide. Actually, the timing was good. I won it in a landslide because I know what to do. Hillary doesn't know what to do. Did you see her yesterday? She has no clue about what we're talking about. Folks, she has no clue. She has no clue. Crooked Hillary. She doesn't know anything about it and, by the way, if she did, she couldn't do it anyway because her donors don't want to do it. There's reasons.\n\nBut look, look. I would go to them and say just to keep them. Just to keep them. And I wouldn't even care that much. I'll tell you why. Ready? I'd say here's the story.\n\nIf you leave, in this case, Indianapolis, you're going to go to Mexico, you're going to make your air conditioning units. Every single unit that you make that crosses our now very, very strong border we're going to charge you 35 percent of the cost of that unit. OK? Thirty five percent. Right?\n\nSo simple. Thirty five percent the cost of that unit. We hope you enjoy your new plant. Very hot weather out there, very hot. We hope you enjoy your new plant, but 35 percent is coming to us. Now, here's what's going to happen if they haven't moved yet. A lot of them have moved.\n\nWe've lost thousands and thousands of companies, we've lost millions of jobs - too late. I should have been there 10 years ago. Nobody would have left. Nobody would have left because you need the right messenger, you know, I'm your messenger in terms of this movement.\n\nBut you need the right person saying it. So, here's what's going to happen. Normally they'd call up whoever it is that was putting the little order down like the new president and they'd have one of their lobbyists call up and they'd say Hillary, I'm sorry, you can't do that, they gave you $2 million for your campaign. Can't do that, Hillary. OK, I won't do that.\n\nWith me, I'm putting my money up, folks. I'm putting my money up. Putting my money up. We're raising money for Reince and for the RNC, but that's for a lot of other reasons. We are putting - I'm putting a lot of money up. I financed my - I funded, not financed, I wish I financed, right? I funded but I funded my primaries and I spent less than anybody else in terms of the measures. So, here's a story - wouldn't that be nice?\n\nI spent less and won in a landslide. Other people spent much, much more. Three, four, five times more and they came in seventh. Who the hell do you want to have as your president, right? Right? Right? Oh, boy, and then they don't like me - couple of them, most of them have really supported us, but some of them just can't get over it. You know what I say to them? Get over it. We're just having fun. Get over it.\n\nYou signed a pledge, I hereby guarantee that I will endorse whoever wins - you know, the funny thing, all those pledges, you know they were signed for different - they were signed so that I would sign it. And I would have honored it, I will say. Even if I wasn't fond or didn't like - I would have honored it because a pledge is a very important thing. But here's the thing. So, we are going to take these companies that haven't left - now, I'm looking at your numbers folks, you're not doing too well.\n\nYou're not doing too well here. Pennsylvania has lost one in three manufacturing jobs since - you know, that's massive, since NAFTA. NAFTA was signed by Bill Clinton and I believe it's the single worst trade document ever signed in the history of our country and probably in the history of our world.\n\nIt's one of the most one-sided documents that I've ever seen. And it allowed Mexico and places to do unbelievably well at our expense. And did you see where say, I'm going to renegotiate NAFTA, I'm going to--TPP disaster. Ok, don't worry. Don't worry.\n\nAnd Hillary was in favor of TPP. She said it's the gold standard. Thank you for reminding me. I like this guy. It's the gold standard. TPP. Transpacific Partnership. It is going to be--I don't think you can be worse than NAFTA honestly. But it's going to be as bad as NAFTA. So TPP, she said it is the gold standard. She's reading it from a teleprompter. It is the gold standard--oh, boy. Our country is in trouble. Our country is in trouble. Our country is in trouble.\n\nSo she said it's the gold standard. But when she heard me make a speech, as I understand it. And she heard me talking very negatively about it. As an example, they don't talk devaluation, which is the single greatest tool that these countries are using to kill the United States, including China. They devalue their currency. Well, it doesn't happen. Number one thing is not mentioned.\n\nSo complicated, this agreement. Too many countries. By the way, I believe trade. I believe in trade deals. One country at a time. Boom. Boom. Boom. You got to see the lines. We'll have one line. And if they don't do well.\n\nIf they don't behave themselves, if they want to start devaluing their currency all over the place, very simple, we write them a notice like we do in business. We serve them with a 30 day notice. \n\nAnd by the way, you just saw, how great are our police, right? \n\nLaw and order. We need law and order. We need law and order and we will have law and order. Our police, our firemen - but our police do a fantastic job. They are not recognized for the great job they do. If they have 500,000 incidents all positively, beautifully handled, one bad thing happens, that one bad thing is on the news for two weeks and it's a disgrace. It's a disgrace.\n\nSo we should be very thankful for the job they do. So, Pennsylvania is losing a lot of its business. Right now, we're sitting here, we're talking - oh, here's another one. Go home to Mom. Go home to Mom. \n\nAnd your mother is voting for trump! She's voting for Trump. It's true. It's true.\n\nBy the way, just to interject - so I was told this whole area is Democratic, meaning Democrat. And I was told that by a lot of different people outside and then they said I can't believe that you have 10,000 people, you have people outside trying to get in.\n\nThey said, the came up to me, this is - happens to be a Democrat who I happen to know is a good guy--came up to me and said I've never seen anything like it. It always goes Democrat. Is that a correct statement? Said, you are going to win Erie in a and the surrounding area - you're going to win in a landslide. Gonna be a landslide. \n\nBecause people are tired of lies, they're tired of losing their jobs, they're tired of seeing their companies being ripped out and going to other places. They're tired of China coming in and dropping steel all over the place to put your companies out of business, so we have to go to China to get our steel, which is happening very quickly.\n\nAnd that's why the steel workers are with me, that's why the miners are with me, that's why the working people, electricians, the plumbers, the sheetrockers, the concrete guys and gals, they're all - they're with us.\n\nAnd I grew up, you know they say, you know you're really rich, how come you sort of relate to these people? Well, my father built houses and I used to work in these houses and I got to know the electricians, I got to know all these people, I got to know the plumbers, the steamfitters--I got to know them all.\n\nAnd I liked them better than the rich people that I know. I know a lot of rich people. It's true. They're better. I like them better.\n\nSo, anyway--and, we are going to put people back to work. We're not playing games. And it's going to go quickly. By the way, it's going to go quickly.\n\nBut look at this, OK. So, Erie, has lost one in three manufacturing jobs. You know that, all I--you do--I flew over, you're looking at the plants, plants that 25 years ago, 20 years ago, 15 years ago, some two years ago, were vibrant.\n\nBut no plant two years ago was too vibrant because it was down to half, down to a quarter, down to a tenth, and then ultimately they closed, but you see them. They are falling over. The rain, the sleet, the snow, the wind. These are great buildings that are falling apart. Don't feel bad, all over the country. Upstate New York is a disaster, which Hillary Clinton said that she was going to fix.\n\nOK, so the Washington Post is extraordinarily dishonest and that's fine. But they wrote a story, I couldn't believe I saw this story, they talked about Hillary Clinton. It was a headline, Hillary Clinton and when she ran for the United States Senator from New York, she said to the people in upstate New York, which was starting to really have problems because of her husband's bill NAFTA.\n\nAnd companies were leaving, tremendous unemployment, tremendous problems, making nothing and she said I will turn it around, I will create 200,000 jobs, we're going to do a great job. Guess what? She got elected, she did nothing. And the only ones that benefited were the consultants and the people that helped her out. It is a disaster. upstate New York is right now worse than anything you have in the state of Pennsylvania, she did nothing.\n\nAnd I watched her yesterday, which was hard to do, because she is boring, OK? \n\nI watched her yesterday talking about--you know what's funny? I said I'm going to renegotiate NAFTA and they said what happens if you can't make a deal, I said we're going to terminate, we're getting out. And \n\nSo I've been saying that and I've been saying we're going to renegotiate different trade deals, and we're going to make great trade deals and all this and she's never said that. All of a sudden, two days ago, I will renegotiate trade deals. She's not going to do it, folks. She's going to renegotiate trade deals the same way she was going to put 200,000 jobs in upstate New York.\n\nIt turned out to be a total fantasy and I have to tell you, I respect the Washington Post for writing one bad story. Because you what they're doing? And Reince was alluding to it a little bit, the only way she gets elected is if they don't report on her. They don't show her. They have me on so much television. There's CNN, you talk about dishonesty, it's called the Clinton--wait--it's called the Clinton News Network, CNN. Now, think of it, Clinton is\n\nShe's hardly ever on. So yesterday, they have yesterday, a scandal with the emails, another one. I'm not talking about the 33,000 emails that she deleted or got rid of. Can you imagine what was on those emails? Can you imagine? I love that. Can you imagine what was on those emails, 33,000 emails were deleted. And she said well it had to do with the wedding and yoga.\n\nI give two to yoga, I give five to the wedding. I'll tell you, the lies, the deception. We're running like they run right now a third world country folks, OK? You saw what happened, it's running like a third world country, we're being talked about all over the world, nobody can believe it.\n\nIn fact, when they were going over the charges against Hillary Clinton, one after another after another after another, however, and yet other people, their lives have been destroyed for doing much less, all right?\n\nTheir lives have been destroyed. So now they have a big scandal in New York. It's in the New York papers, but very little. Pay right? Pay for play. And it's horrifying, it's horrifying. Our government is for sale. Our government is for sale by a crooked person. And what they're doing is they're trying to not talk about her. Take a look. You go to CNN as an example. Story after story about Trump. Story--Trump. Trump. Trump. Trump.\n\nAnd yesterday, it was announced that people are tired of negative--the hit jobs and CNN's starting to do very poorly. That's good. I like that. I like that. And I have to say, Fox has been treating us fairly. Fox has been fair. But CNN has been catastrophic. It's so dishonest.\n\nBut somebody was explaining to me their theory. If they don't report on her, people aren't going to know how bad she is. Look at her news conference. She hasn't had a news conference in like 260 days. That last one wasn't a news conference. That was a few of her friends. They asked her a question. What did she say about the circuit, right? Let me tell you, if I ever said that, short- circuited, if I ever said I short-circuited, it would be headlines all over the world. They would call for the death penalty. \n\nCan you imagine if I said that I short-circuited? I mean, I stand up here for months in front of massive crowds, she gets 300 people going to her events. She gets 300 people and then she reads something from a teleprompter and then she leaves and she goes home and she goes to sleep. \n\nAnd then she wakes and she goes again. And I'm telling you--and nobody does anything about it. Now me, I stand up here--I'm not looking at notes. I'm not reading teleprompters. Not easy. Not easy. Not easy. \n\nBut--but--remember--but--and if I make one mistake  say, he mention something wrong. He got a wrong date. It's like headlines all over. She can say she short-circuited up here. I don't want a president who short-circuits. Is that OK? I don't want it. I don't want a president who short-circuits. \n\nWe've got to deal with ISIS. We've got to deal with China. We've got to deal with lots of people. They're not short-circuiting. But I don't want somebody that short-circuits. So let me just tell you--let me just tell you.\n\nOver the last little while--you know, every time, it's always a big deal. When I said that Obama--and of course, I'm being sarcastic. And they know that because after I said that, I said he's the MVP, he's going to collect his MVP award. OK.\n\nSo I said Obama is the founder of ISIS. The founder. \n\nAnd these dishonest media people--they're the most dishonest people. They said oh, did he mean that? Didn't he mean that? And after that, I'd say a lot--in fact, they like him so much because he's been so weak and so bad. I mean, he let this happen. They had eight states. They had eight countries. They're now in 28 countries. They're expanding.\n\nSo I said the founder of--obviously, I'm being sarcastic. Then--then--but not that sarcastic, to be honest with you. \n\nAnd they all said, he should not say that. They should call him an enabler. Call him an enabler. He's an enabler. I said, that doesn't sound the same. He's an enabler. People are going to say what's--these people are the worst. But listen, so I said the founder of ISIS. And in fact, very soon he's going over to pick up his most valuable player award. Did I say that? I say it all the time.  So they knew I was being sarcastic. By now they're analyzing. Did I really mean that? How could I say that? These people are the lowest form of life. I'm telling you. The lowest. \n\nThey are the lowest form of humanity. Not all of them. They have about 25 percent that are pretty good, actually. But most of them.\n\nOK. So, here's the story. So Erie has lost a lot. Right? You know that, right? Hang in, don't leave. I promise we can fix it so fast. We will stop these countries from taking our jobs. We will stop these countries from taking our companies. Hold on.\n\nOur jobs will come back. Now, I came up with a great plan. I'm lowering corporate taxes so our companies stay, so I don't even have to make the call. The corporate inversions - you know, we have companies that have, they say, two and a half trillion dollars outside of our comp - they can't get their money back. We don't let them.\n\nEverybody agrees that we should do it. Republicans, Democrats, everybody agrees.\n\nWhat's the - look, why do we not want them to bring money back? You know why? Because we don't have a president that can sit the leaders of both parties around a table and in about five minutes let them say let's bring this money back in so we can work it in this country, right?\n\nThat's what it is. So we're going to bring that money back in, we're going to lower taxes, we're going to keep our companies - and if our companies want to leave, they're going to pay a nice big beautiful tax to get their product back in.\n\nOK? That's what's going to happen. So, the existing U.S. trade deficit with TPP participating nations has already cost Pennsylvania 68,000 jobs, folks. No more, folks.\n\nWe're not going to be stupid people any more, we're going to be the really, really smart people. It's going to be America first. America first. America first. First. \n\nSo, the destruction of manufacturing in Pennsylvania was caused by Hillary Clinton's and her husband's disastrous trade policies.\n\nI mean, you take a look at what she's done. At the bidding of her corporate funders, Hillary Clinton has backed every job-killing trade deal for decades. She has received so much money, she has approved virtually every tax increase put before her.\n\nYesterday - you see 1.3 trillion in tax increases. We're the highest taxed nation in the land, essentially. We're the highest taxed nation in the world. Anywhere in the world.\n\nAnd of the industrialized nations, we're far and away the highest taxed nation. And she's proposing a massive tax increase. Folks, we can't do it. It's going to make our country non-competitive - it's already non-competitive.\n\nIt's going to make our country non-competitive and we're not going to do it. I'm proposing a massive tax decrease for the middle class, for business, and businesses are going to pour in - not since Ronald Reagan has anything like this been proposed.\n\nBusinesses instead of leaving because their taxes are so high, they're going to stay. I might not even have to make those calls. Now, if I do, I will, meaning my people will. I'll do some, I love doing it. I would love telling some guy you're not moving. Well, Mr. President, sir, we would like to move to Mexico. You're not moving and if you do you pay the 35 percent tax. You say Well, in that case, I'm not moving, I'm not moving. In that case, I'm not moving. So easy.\n\nSo, your coal industry, your steel industry, which has been ravaged, your General Electrics of the world, which have been ravaged, just ravaged, we're going to end it and I'll tell you why. Over the years, I've watched. For years, for 10 years, for 12 years, for 15 years, beyond Obama, and I've watched as politicians talked about stopping countries from leaving - companies from leaving our states. You need strength, is right.\n\nOur states. And I watched. Remember they give the low-interest loans? Here's a low-interest loan if you stay in Pennsylvania, here's a zero-interest loan, you don't have to pay, here's a this, here's tax abatement of any kind you want, we'll help your - it doesn't work, folks, that's not what they need. They have money.\n\nThey want to go out, they want to move to another country and because our politicians are so dumb, they want to sell their product to us and not have any retribution, not have any consequences.\n\nSo all of that's over and I think you understand it and Hillary can't do it. Number one, she can't do it because the mentality isn't there. She can't do it. No, the mentality.\n\nYou know, she said fairly recently, I don't like Donald Trump's tone. His tone isn't nice. And I said, here we have a country that's being taken advantage of by every country in the world. Our businesses are being taken. Our jobs being taken. Everything's being taken.\n\nHere we have a world where ISIS is chopping off the heads of Christians and many others, drowning people in steel cages, burying people in the sand, and we have somebody up there who wants to be our president that says, I don't like Donald Trump's tone. \n\nFolks, we better get smart, folks. Hey, look, let's see what happens. We better get smart. We better get smart. \n\nWe better get smart. We better get tough. And if we're not smart and we're not tough, we're not going to have a country left. And one of the things I have to talk to you about before I leave is our borders. Illegal immigrants are pouring into our country. In fact, I brought something for you people. I brought--I brought--I had to do this. I didn't want to depress you. OK, look. The Clinton legacy.\n\nNearly one in three manufacturing jobs in Erie, PA--Erie, PA, sound familiar--have been lost since Clinton allowed a certain deal with China to happen. Now, look at this--look at this chart. This is 2001, not long ago. This is now. Congratulations, folks. I hope you're doing well. OK? I hope you're doing well. I don't want to hurt them. I hope you're doing well.\n\nBut you know what? You can't do well. When you have a government that is so stupid, that is so--that is so incompetent, you can't do it. Here's another one, folks. This is what we're talking about. Syrian refugees--we have no idea who they are, where they're coming from, no paperwork. You saw what happened in San Bernardino. You saw what happened--frankly, take a look at all over the world. Take a look at what's happening.\n\nIf we don't get smart and we don't get smart fast--Barack Obama is allowing Syrian refugees to come into our country by the thousands. Now, I have as big a heart as anybody in this room and I want to build safe zones and I want, by the way, the Gulf states to pay for it because they've got plenty of money and they're not doing much. OK? We'll supervise it. OPM, other people's money. We'll supervise it, right? We'll supervise it.\n\nBut they're going to pay for it because we're protecting these people. If it weren't for the United States, those countries wouldn't even exist. They'd be gone. The power we have is so enormous, but we have people that don't know what they're doing. We have an incompetent president. We have people that don't know what they're doing.\n\nSo look at this. Look at this. Syrian refugees admitted to the United States on a monthly basis. Look what's happening. Look what's happening. \n\nNow, in all fairness, we want to help people. Can't take a chance. San Bernardino, they walk in. They start shooting. Paris, the best, the toughest gun laws in the world, Paris, France. They walk in. They kill 130 people. They wound so gravely hundreds of people.\n\nNow, let me just tell you because well--we're on the Second Amendment, right, Second Amendment. If we had in San Bernardino--if we had in San Bernardino or in Orlando or someplace, somebody in that room like this guy right here, right, or that guy with the blue make America great again hat on or the one with the red make America--or that woman with the beautiful blonde hair. I wish I had hair that looked like that. \n\nBut if we had somebody and they happened to have a gun, San Bernardino, they see him come in--first of all, if they knew there was a gun where the bullets would be flying in the other direction, they probably wouldn't have got  in, OK? But let's assume they did.\n\nThe carnage would not have been what the carnage was. We have to protect our Second Amendment. Hillary Clinton wants to kill our second amendment. \n\nShe wants to kill it. \n\nSo here's our chart. And I was thinking about doing a--I bring--every once in a--like, one in ten I do it, you know a lot of these. I love the people. We have such a movement going on. Who likes the snake? Do you know the snake? Do you like it? Who likes the snake? Here we are with this. We know bad things are going to happen. We know as we allow more and more people to come in from these terror areas, bad things are going to happen.\n\nHas anybody heard the snake? Not that many? Should I do it again? So think of this, folks, think of this, think of it. This is what is going on in our country with our borders. And by the way, we're going to have a strong border, we're going to have a wall, it's going to be a powerful wall that Mexico's going to pay for the wall. \n\nAnd we have no choice, and we have no choice. But think of this. This is now a situation where this was written by Al Wilson many years ago and I read it and I said you know that really pertains to what's happening to the United States and it has to do with being fooled, it has to do with a lot of different things but when you're listening to this, think of our border, think of the people that we're letting in by the thousands and Hillary Clinton, you saw those numbers right? With the chart, it's through the roof.\n\nHillary Clinton wants to allow 550 percent more coming into our country. How stupid are we? So, are you ready, you ready, you like it, you sure? On her way to work one morning, down the path along the lake, a tender hearted woman saw a poor, half-frozen snake, his pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew. Oh well, she cried, I'll take you in and I'll take care of you.\n\nTake me in, oh tender woman, take me in for heaven's sake, take me in oh tender woman, sighed the broken snake. She wrapped him up, all cozy, in a curvature of silk. Then laid him by the fireside with some honey and some milk. Now she hurried home from work that night. As soon as she arrived, she found that pretty snake she'd taken in, had been revived. Take me in oh tender woman, take me in for heaven's sake.\n\nTake me in oh tender woman, sighed the broken snake. Now she clutched him to her bosom. You're so beautiful, she cried. But if I hadn't brought you in by now, you certainly would have died. Now she stroked his pretty skin and then she kissed and held him tight. But instead of saying thank you, that snake gave her a vicious bite. Take me in oh tender woman, take me in for heaven's sake.\n\nTake me in oh tender woman, sighed the vicious snake. I saved you, I saved you, I saved you, cried that woman. And you've bit me, heaven's why. You know your bite is poisonous and now I'm going to die. Oh shut up, silly woman, said the reptile with a grin. You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in. \n\nGet ready folks, get ready. We're led by stupid people. We're led by leaders and you know honestly, I didn't need this. This I didn't need. I had a nice life, built a great company--a great company, some of the great real estate assets of the world. I may never see them. You know if I win, I may never see them again, and I love them--all over the world.\n\nBut you know what? This is so important. And I watched what was happening with the Iran deal, and I watched what was happening with jobs, and I watched what was happening with trade where China makes $500 billion in trade deficits with us.\n\nI look and I saw. Take a look at Mexico. You know, the politicians say, you'll never, ever be able to get Mexico to allow you to build a wall. I say trust me. Now, they don't say that anymore. Now they say, they won't put the money up to build a wall. So easy. Mexico--our trade deficit is massive, massive. They make a fortune off the stupidity of the United Stated.\n\nMexico will 100 percent--you hear--100 percent pay for the wall, 100 percent. \n\nOK? One hundred percent. But the story of the snake is what's happening to our country. We're letting people in. Many of these people hate us. Many of these people don't have good thoughts. And you see what one person can do--one sick wacko can do in Orlando. And then you see his father sitting behind Hillary Clinton with a big smile on his face--with a big, fat smile on his face, right?\n\nAnd he was wearing a red hat, and I said, I hope that's not one of my hats. It wasn't. I was concerned. I saw that hat. I said, I hope it doesn't say make America great again. Bad guy--bad guy. Horrendous son--horrendous son.\n\nSo here's the story, folks. We have to win--we have to win Pennsylvania, so important. So \n\nHillary Clinton is run by people that do this very professionally. They're very good. They keep her out of the spotlight. She doesn't talk to reporters--very rarely. She doesn't do press conferences. She doesn't expose whatever's going on up here. She doesn't--which isn't good. She doesn't expose her mind to questions. And what they want to do is they want to try and fake it through.\n\nWe need strength. We need toughness. We need a strong temperament. We need a strong tone. At the same time--at the same time, let me tell you--at the same time, we need real, big, beautiful heart because we have to straighten out healthcare. Obamacare's going to be repealed and replaced.\n\nIt's going to repay--did you see--did you see what's happening with Obamacare? Did you see where the numbers are going up 30, 40, and 50 percent? Wait until you see what happens on November 1st. Now, on November 1st, they're trying to delay it.\n\nBut you're going to get increases, the likes of which probably no country, nobody has ever seen. OK? Anybody in the history of healthcare--in Texas, through going through Blue Cross Blue Shield, they just had almost a 50 percent increase in their premiums.\n\nAnd the deductibles are so high that unless you get hit by one of those General Electric locomotives and you live for like a long time prior to death, you'll never, ever be able to use your healthcare--the healthcare. Because here's what's happened--here's what's happened. The deductible is so high, you never get to use it.\n\nSo, you're spending money, your deductibles raises by 17, 18, 19 percent. But now, it's going to go really bad, really bad. It's going to die of its own volition, but we have to kill it first. It's killing our country, it's killing our jobs--it's killing our jobs.\n\nSo, here's the story, folks--folks. We have to win Pennsylvania. We have to beat this professional group of people that are running her for her own--for their own purposes. We have to win Pennsylvania. We win Pennsylvania, we're going to win it. You know, we're up in Florida. We're doing well in Ohio. And I'm hearing we're doing well here. We'll find out.\n\nHere's the story... \n\nHere's the story. We have to win the state of Pennsylvania. I went to school here. My kids went to school here. We're going to win Pennsylvania.\n\nIf we win Pennsylvania, I'll tell you what. We are very much on our way. You know, the Republicans do have a tougher path, just so you--not my fault. Not my fault. It's a tougher path.\n\nFor the presidency, it's just a tougher, winding road. But if win Pennsylvania, we win Florida where we're doing really well, I think we can win Ohio, it'll be over. It'll be over. It'll be over. \n\nSo, on November 8th, you have to get out and vote or do some balloting, and I don't care--look, here's the story. If you're not feeling well, if you're so sick, if you go to your doctor and he goes, I'm sorry sir, but you've only got a few weeks left. And it's November 1st. And he gives you the ultimate word, not looking good. You haven't got long left. I don't care and nobody else in this room cares. You have to on November 8th get out of bed and get out and vote, right? Get out and vote. \n\nNow, in a lot of cases, you can do your early ballots too. All I'm telling you though--look, folks. I'm just saying your jobs have been taken. Your military and all of the other things, we're going to save your Second Amendment, which is protection, we're going to get of Common Core, you're going to bring your education locally. \n\nAll things--I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare. All these things. We're going to take care of our vets. But here's the story, folks. For you people in particular because you have been devastated.\n\nSupreme Court, he said. Yes. Yes. Thank you. Who did that? Who said that? Thank you.\n\nBy the way, and I have to just stop for a second. Look, Supreme Court Justice Scalia great. Was supposed to live for a long time. He died. So you have already an empty. This next president could have the most Supreme Court nominations of any president. Could take more justices than--it could be up to five. Probably going to be three, could be four, could be five. OK?\n\nIf Hillary Clinton gets to put hard-leaning left judges on the Supreme Court, number one, your Second Amendment will be gone. Our country will never ever be the same. We will have problems like we've never had before and you won't have--you will have a whole different deal going, which we don't want, believe me.\n\nSo, here's the story. If for no other reason, I am going to put--and you know, I've picked through Federalist society--we picked 11 Supreme Court justices. We're going to add probably four more, all vetted through Federalists, through Heritage, highly--I actually got very good marks. We're going to pick these people or people very like that.\n\nSo, here's the story, here's the story. You ready? We don't win anymore, you people don't win, that's for sure. You just have to look at the statistics for jobs. We're going to start winning again. We're going to win so much that you're going to get sick and tired of winning.\n\nYou're going to say Mr. President--you're going to send the congressman to see me in Washington. He's going to say, Mr. President, we have to do something. The people of Pennsylvania, and in particular our friends in Erie, they're sick and tired of winning. They can't stand winning so much. Mr. President, we just don't want to win that much. We really want to give other nations like it used to be, where it's good for them and bad for us, at least a little bit.\n\nAnd I'm going to say--I'm going to say, Mr. Congressman, I don't think you know your people very well, they want to win. And we want to win. And you want to win. And we're going to win. We're going to win so much. We're going to win with our military, we're going to knock the hell out of ISIS. \n\nWe're going to win for our vets. We're going to take of our vets. We're going to win at the border, we're going to build a wall, we're going to have Mexico pay, believe me 100 percent. We're going to win with education. We're going to win for our Second Amendment. We're going to win on all of the things we discussed. We're going to win again and you're going to be proud of your country again.\n\nWe're not going to be the people that are laughed at all over the world for not knowing what we're doing, for allowing others to come in and just strip us of what we have. \n\nWe are going to win. We are going to be America first. \n\nWe are going to make America great again. And it's going to happen quickly. \n\nThank you everybody, thank you. \u0000","85":"Thank you so much! Thank you. Wow, thank you all. What a great way to celebrate my birthday being here in Tampa!\nI am so, so grateful to Josh for that wonderful introduction. He's an incredibly talented chef, but more than that, I have to say he's a humanitarian. He just came back from Haiti, once again, where he goes periodically to help feed people. He's been doing it ever since the terrible earthquake, going to help people in remote villages - and he does that all over the world when it comes to making sure that there are clean cookstoves so that people can cook, primarily women and children, without fear of getting sick from inhaling all the smoke. I enlisted Josh-\u00c2\u0095s help when I was Secretary of State on the clean cookstoves initiative. And as you heard, he's also a proud immigrant and - he is standing up to Donald Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric, and he's doing it in a very courageous way because he sacrificed his business. He'd been asked by the Trump Organization to put a restaurant into the new hotel that Trump was talking about on TV today, in Washington, and after Josh heard the kinds of things that Donald Trump was saying about immigrants, he said, 'No, I refuse to open a restaurant in that hotel.' That is really gutsy.\n\nAnd today was a perfect time to have Josh be with us because, as I said, Donald Trump is taking time off the campaign trail to officially open the hotel. And yesterday, here in Florida, he took time out to invite the press to listen to his employees talk about what a great boss he is while he was watching and listening to them.\n\nAnd today, in opening that hotel, I think it's important to note that he once again relied on undocumented workers. The same people he has been insulting and demonizing throughout this campaign. So, like with so much else that Donald Trump says, he says one thing and then he does something different. Many of the products in the hotel were made overseas rather than here in the United States, and he even sued the District of Columbia to pay lower taxes. That is the way that he does business.\n\nNow, we've actually learned in this campaign that Donald Trump is the poster boy for everything wrong with our economy. He refuses to pay workers and contractors from Atlantic City to Miami to Las Vegas. He stiffs small businesses. I take that one personally because my dad was a small businessman. And I've met so many people who did projects for Donald Trump - provided pianos for one of his casinos, installed drapes for one of his hotels, laid the marble, put in the glass, washed the dishes, painted - and then weren't paid. I just think that is fundamentally wrong and that is not the kind of experience we need in the Oval Office.\n\nSo I'm grateful to Josh and I want to thank everyone else - my great friend, your United States Senator Bill Nelson. Congresswoman Kathy Castor. Mayor Bob Buckhorn, who's here with his two daughters. Governor Charlie Crist, soon to be Congressman Charlie Crist. I have to say, we've got two great candidates here: David Singer, candidate for the House of Representatives; and Rena Frazier, another candidate. And we have the great talent of Angela Bassett with us today.\n\nSo, my friends, here's the advice that I got. It is a beautiful day in Tampa, but it's warm. And some of you have been here a while, right? And I'm watching the flags. So long as they're waving, I know there's a breeze. If they stop waving, I'm really going to cut this short.\n\nBut let me start by thanking you - thanking you for being here.\n\nThank you. Thank you. Well, I'll tell you, if I ever need a pickup, I'm coming back to Tampa, Mayor. And with 13 days left in this election, we cannot stop for a minute. No complacency here. Nobody-- nobody flagging. We've got to get everybody out to vote. And I hope in addition to the people that I've mentioned, someone who's not here I hope you will support - that is Congressman Patrick Murphy, to send him to the United States Senate.\n\nI think you'll be pleased because he's an independent voice. He's a problem-solver. He believes in comprehensive immigration reform. He has stood with Planned Parenthood against the attacks that it has suffered. He has even brought Democrats and Republicans together to try to protect our environment and fund Everglades restoration. He'll stand up to the gun lobby and advocate for common sense gun safety measures. He'll defend Social Security and Medicare, not cutting or privatizing those two essential programs. So please, do your best to make sure we send Patrick Murphy to the Senate.\n\nNow, I got to ask you, anybody see the last debate? You know, I have now stood next to Donald Trump for four and a half hours, proving conclusively I have the stamina to do the job.\n\nAnd every time he says one of those outrageous things that he does have a - yeah, 'Wrong' - he does have a way of saying, I just keep remembering Michelle Obama's words: when he goes low, we go high.\n\nBut I got to say, he said something in the last debate we've never heard from anybody running for president. He basically said that he's not sure - he refused to say that he would respect the results of the election. Now, this is a guy who said the Emmys were rigged, so you can't really take what he says very seriously. But this is a problem because the first thing a president does at noon on January 20th is to take an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution. And if you are casting doubts, you want to keep people in suspense as to whether you will respect the outcome of an election, that is contrary to who we are as Americans. We have our elections; we've had them from George Washington forward. We're going to keep having them and show what a democracy looks like to the rest of the world.\n\nI believe strongly that the American people are going to reject this dark, divisive vision of America, and it's happening, my friends. We have reached a milestone. More than 200 million Americans are registered to vote. That's the biggest number ever. And that number includes 50 million young people. And you know what else? More than 10 million people have already voted, including 2 million right here in Florida.\n\nI'm hearing some great stories from people. Let me just tell you one. It's about Steven, from St. Augustine. He's been fighting a rare form of leukemia and heart disease. He's been in and out of the hospitals a dozen times in the last two years. But he knows how important his vote is. So I heard yesterday he ditched his oxygen tank, which I would not have recommended - clung to his walker, stood in line so he could cast his vote for a better America. And if Steven can do that, nobody has any excuses. And I think this extends not just to Democrats but to Republicans and independents, and I am proud to have support from Republicans and independents here, across Florida, and across America who agree with me that we should reject hate and division.\n\nWe have seen Donald Trump insult nearly every person in America, and I just find that so intolerable. Because look at this diverse crowd; look at Tampa. It's a cosmopolitan city. Florida is paving the way for what our country will look like, and we need to be lifting each other up, listening to each other, respecting each other, not sowing seeds of hatred and bigotry. And I think one of my biggest jobs after this election will be bringing our country together, and I'm going to need your help.\n\nWe're going to get the economy working for everybody, not just people at the top, with new jobs in infrastructure. That rail system, Bob, that you want, we're going to get it because it would help you so much. Think of the people we'd put to work - technology, innovation, research, advanced manufacturing, and yes, small business. I want to be the best small business president you can have, to help people start and grow their businesses. But we're also going to make America the clean energy superpower of the 21st century. I know we can create millions of jobs, and we can protect Florida, especially coastal Florida, and we can protect our planet at the same time. You're already seeing the results of climate change here in Florida. I was just in Miami, and they actually have flooding on sunny days with no rain. People are calling 3-1-1 because they think a water main broke, but it's the oceans rising. So I know there is no state that could benefit more from a clean energy agenda than Florida, and that's exactly what we're going to do.\n\nWe're also going to make public colleges and universities tuition-free. If your family makes less than $125,000, which is most families in America, you're not going to have to pay a penny to go to a public college or university. If your family makes more than that, you're not going to have to go into debt - pay what you can afford, and then we're going to make sure you can go without getting a big debt, because that drags people down. And for people who already have debt, we are going to help you refinance it and pay it off.\n\nAnd I want to say something to all of the teachers and educators. I want to work with you and be a good partner with you. And I think there should be more than one way, more than just a four-year college degree, to get a good job with a good middle-class life for you and your families. So let's invest in more technical education in high school, in our community colleges. Let's have more apprenticeship programs - labor and business together.\n\nBut while we grow the economy, let's make it fairer. We need to raise the national minimum wage so that people who work full-time aren't left in poverty. I got to tell you, I was raised to believe in hard work. My grandfather was a factory worker, my dad had a small business, and we really believed you've got to work for what you get in life, right? But if you're working, you shouldn't be at the point where you cannot even afford food or clothes or rent at the end of the year.\n\nAnd isn't it finally time to guarantee equal pay for women's work? You know, this is not just a women's issue. This is a family issue. If you've got a mother, a wife, a sister, or a daughter working, it's your issue. And unlike my opponent, we're going to ask the wealthy, the millionaires and billionaires, to pay their fair share, because we're going to close the loopholes and make sure no multimillionaire ever pays a lower tax rate than a nurse or a teacher or a police officer or a firefighter. And I will not raise taxes on anyone making less than $250,000 a year.\n\nSo when you go to the polls, vote to grow the economy, more jobs with rising incomes, vote to make the economy fairer. And compare that with what my opponent has proposed. He really believes if you give trillions - that's trillions with a 't' - trillions in tax cuts to the wealthy, millionaires, billionaires, big corporations, everything will trickle down. Now, we know that doesn't work; we've seen it. And it's pretty rich coming from a guy who claims to be so rich, who hasn't paid a dime in federal income taxes in 20 years. He says not making taxes makes him smart. Well, I don't know. I don't know how smart you have to be to lose a billion dollars in one year. And besides, what kind of genius loses money running a casino, for heaven's sakes?\n\nActually, it sounds like a few people have been at casinos here. But this means he's contributed zero, okay? He actually has the gall to call our military a disaster. Not only is he wrong, but what right does he have to say that? He hasn't contributed a penny to our military, not a penny to our veterans, not a penny to health care or education, not a penny to highways or infrastructure. This is a false - false - charge that he makes about all the problems in our country.\n\nAnd I'll tell you something; we did a little research. He's been denigrating America for decades. This didn't start with his birther lie against President Obama. It didn't even start running against me. Back in 1987, he took out a $100,000 ad in The New York Times criticizing President Reagan. He said our leaders were the laughing stock of the world. So this is a guy who criticizes everybody but himself. And at some point, you got to say, wait a minute, we're better than that. We are stronger than that. We want to forward - forward - into the future with confidence and optimism, and that's what we're offering in this campaign.\n\nI got to tell you, it is not just what we're against that should motivate you to go to the polls; it's what we are for. And I believe strongly that what we're for will make it possible for all of us, and especially our kids and our grandkids, to have the best future. America's best days can still be ahead of us. But we can't make any of this happen if we don't have you voting.\n\nNow, Donald Trump says he can still win, and he's right. That's why it's so important everyone gets out and votes. And here in Florida - in a lot of places, you can only vote on Election Day, but here in Florida, voting couldn't be easier. Early voting began on Monday. In south Florida, it goes through Sunday, November 6 around the state. You can go to an early voting site between 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. In fact, the County Center on East Kennedy Boulevard is just a 10-minute walk from here. You can go vote right after this event. And we'll have staff ready to help you get there. And you can go to iwillvote.com to confirm your polling place and make a plan to vote.\n\nBut I also hope you will volunteer these last two weeks. We're reaching out to everybody. So go to hillaryclinton.com and sign up to volunteer. Take out your phone and text J-O-I-N, and that is 47246. We can use you. We're making millions of phone calls in Florida. We're knocking on maybe by the time we finish millions of doors.\n\nWe don't want anybody to be left out or left behind because on January 20th, America will have a new president. I've got to say - so I've got to say to you that change is inevitable in life. Right? And so the real question is, what kind of change are we going to have? And I want you to talk to anybody you know who is either thinking of not voting or maybe thinking of voting for my opponent. No. I'm serious. I'm serious. After this election, if I'm fortunate enough to be elected, we are going to reach out to everybody. Right? And ask. Ask the people you're talking to what kind of change they really want because I don't think most Americans want the kind of divisive and dark change Donald Trump is offering: mass deportations that will rip families apart, a repeal of gun-free school zones on day one, going back to the day when insurance companies could discriminate against us if we have a preexisting condition, letting Wall Street write its own rules, denying the science of climate change, rolling back marriage equality, defunding Planned Parenthood, the hugest tax breaks ever for the wealthy, and abroad abandoning our alliances and allowing more countries to get nuclear weapons.\"\n\n\nNow, that may be change, but, boy, that's not the change we need. And my vision is different. It's more hopeful, optimistic, and unifying. I want us to be a country where every student could afford to go to college if that's what you choose. I want us to be a country where millions of people are working in good, high-paying jobs and in new industries, like clean energy and advanced manufacturing. I want us to be a country where hard-working immigrants, who pay taxes - and, by the way, one-half of undocumented workers pay federal income taxes, which means they are paying more federal income taxes than Donald Trump paid. And a country where we not only have equal pay for our work but affordable childcare, where we're respected in the world, working with our allies to defeat terrorism and stop the spread of nuclear weapons. So yes, change is coming, The choice is yours about what kind of change we'll have.\n\nAnd I hope you will choose to be part of this campaign because it's not just about winning on November 8th, as important as that is. It is about getting to work because I do believe we are stronger together.\n\nTim Kaine and I wrote a book laying out our agenda because I think you deserve to know what I will try to do as your president. So if you will help, we will come together to give every American the chance to chart your own future and contribute to our great country.\n\nLet's prove once and for all that love trumps hate.\n\nThank you.\u0000","86":"Thank you.\nIn 24 days, we are going to win the state of Maine and we are going to win the White House.\n\nMake sure to get your absentee ballots.\n\nTogether, we are going to deliver real change that puts America First.\n\nMy economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs.\n\nWe are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals, end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, reduce surging crime, cut taxes and regulations, lift the restrictions on American energy, end common core, and repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.\n\nWe are also going to replace a failed political class that has betrayed our workers, spent trillions on endless foreign wars without victory, and destroyed our middle class.\n\nYour jobs will come back under a Trump Administration. Your incomes will go up under a Trump Administration. Your taxes will go way down under a Trump Administration. Your energy bills will go way down under a Trump Administration. Your companies won't be leaving Maine under a Trump Administration.\n\nWe are going to be a rich country again.\n\nWe are also going to end government corruption.\n\nHillary speaks in secret to Goldman Sachs - her private position - then lies to you, the public, with her public position. It's all a fraud.\n\nHillary Clinton deleted 33,000 emails - after a Congressional Subpoena - she lied to Congress under oath, she made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer, and now we learn 2 boxes of email evidence mysteriously went missing.\n\nHillary Clinton should have been prosecuted, and gone to jail for her crimes. The FBI and the Department of Justice created a fraud in allowing Hillary Clinton to get away with her terrible crimes - and I guarantee you, the Clintons are laughing at them. The Director's performance in Congress, coupled with Bill Clinton's clandestine meeting on the tarmac in the Attorney General's airplane just prior to decision-time on Hillary - supposedly talking about golf and grandchildren - is perhaps the lowest point in those department's history.\n\nInstead of being held accountable, Hillary is running for President in what looks like a rigged election. The election is being rigged by corrupt media, pushing false allegations and outright lies, in an effort to elect her President.\n\nBut we are going to stop it. We are not going to back down. We are not going to let it happen.\n\nWe have only just begun to fight.\n\nAmericans have had it with the years, the decades, of Clinton Corruption. This will finally be the year the American people say: Enough is Enough.\n\nSpeaking in secret to a foreign bank Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally \"open trade and open borders.\" Hillary and Bill raise millions of dollars from global interest groups who have no allegiance to this country or its workers.\n\nBy \"open trade,\" she means foreign countries can cheat us out of millions of jobs and trillions of dollars.\n\nBy \"open borders,\" she means totally unlimited immigration.\n\nEither we win the election, or we lose the country.\n\nHillary's plan includes an open border with the Middle East - meaning generations of radicalism within our shores. She wants us to follow the path of France and Germany and import terrorism directly into the United States.\n\nSo let me state this as clearly as I can. If I'm elected President I am going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country.\n\nWe will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration.\n\nA Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders. And yes, we will build a wall.\n\nWe have the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers.\n\nIt was just reported that a man deported from our country 10 times in six years has been charged with raping a 12-year old girl. In August, Texas Police arrested a serial illegal immigrant rapist who had been deported five times, including one 68 year-old woman with a cane who took his offer to drive her home. He left her on the side of a dirt road.\n\nWhat kind of government allows its own people to suffer such horrors?\n\nAs Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be released because their home countries wouldn't take them back. Among those she allowed to go free was a criminal alien who had previously been convicted for shooting a girl in the head - after his release, he viciously murdered a young girl name Casey Chadwick.\n\nA wall will not only keep out criminals, but it will also keep out the drugs and heroin poisoning our youth.\n\nDrugs overdoses in Maine are on a record pace.\n\nI have outlined a plan to stop the opioid crisis. My plan begins with a strong border, includes the prosecution of drug dealers, and dramatically expands access to life-saving treatments that will help people unchain themselves from this terrible addiction.\n\nBut, if we are going to bring hope back to suffering Americans, we must also solve our jobs crisis.\n\nAt the center of our economic revival will be fixing our terrible trade deals.\n\n47 million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are on Food Stamps.\n\nWe have nearly an $800 billion annual trade deficit in goods with the world, and the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.\n\nThis is the legacy of Obama-Clinton.\n\nWhen I am President, everything will change. We will move people from the welfare rolls to the employment rolls. We will end our chronic trade deficits. We will start growing again.\n\nWe'll rebuild our roads, schools, bridges, tunnels, railways, hospitals and airports.\n\nThe state of Maine has lost nearly 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton.\n\nSince China entered the World Trade Organization - another Bill and Hillary-backed deal - 70,000 factories have shut down or left the United States.\n\nThat's 15 factories closing a day, on average.\n\nWe are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.\n\nIf I win, day one, we are going to announce our plans to renegotiate NAFTA. If we don't get the deal we want, we'll leave NAFTA and start over to get a much better deal.\n\nWe are going to start making things in America again.\n\nAs part of our plan to bring back our jobs, we are going to lower our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent.\n\nWe will lower taxes massively on all Americans - Hillary will raise your taxes massively. Our biggest reductions will be for the working and middle class - this includes letting parents deduct the cost of childcare.\n\nReagan's tax cuts in the eighties, and Kennedy's tax cuts in the sixties, brought us tremendous growth. My economic reforms - on taxes, trade, regulation and American energy - will produce at least 25 million newjobs in a decade. It's the most pro-growth economic plan in American history.\n\nWe are also going to protect the right of the people of Maine to use their own land.\n\nPresident Obama, with the support of politicians like Hillary Clinton, issued an executive order 2 months ago making over 87,000 acres in Maine into a new \"National Monument.\" No consideration was made for local concerns, impacts to jobs, or the Maine forestry sector. No approval by Congress. Your state legislature opposed it. It is just another federal overreach that is going to do more harm than good. Obama and Clinton don't care that this area badly needs jobs and growth and that this decision -- done at the stroke of the pen without the support of the local community-- undermines the people that live and work here in Maine.\n\nBut we are going to turn it all around. America's comeback begins on November 8th.\n\nHere are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:\n\nWe are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; defend religious liberty; reduce the cost of tuition; provide school choice to every low-income child in America; rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; support the men and women of law enforcement; repeal and replace Obamacare; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\n\nYou have 24 days to make every dream you ever dreamed of for your country come true.\n\nOn November 8th, the arrogance of Washington D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.\n\nI am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation.\n\nI'm going to fight for every child living in poverty. I'm going to fight for every mom whose lost her child to illegal immigration, and drugs and gang violence.\n\nI'm going to fight for every worker who deserves a raise, and for every community whose jobs and dreams have been ripped out and shipped to other countries.\n\nI'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people - not the donors.\n\nI'm going to fight for every patriotic citizen that Hillary Clinton slanders as deplorable and irredeemable - and I am going to be a President for all of our citizens.\n\nI am going to fight to bring us together as Americans.\n\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\n\nYou're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this day. This is a movement like you've never seen before. We're going to make history together. You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote you've ever cast for anyone at any time.\n\nOnce again, we are going to have a government of, by and for the people.\n\nWe will make America wealthy again.\n\nWe will make America powerful again.\n\nWe will make America strong again.\n\nWe will make America safe again.\n\nAnd we will make America great again.\u0000","87":"Thank you! Wow! Hello, Akron! Wow! I am so excited! It's just fabulous being back here again. I am so grateful to all of you. I want to thank your mayor, Mayor Horrigan. Thank you for welcoming me here. I want to thank two great members of Congress who fight for Akron, fight for Cleveland, fight for Youngstown, fight for Ohio and America, Congresswoman Marcia Fudge and Congressman Tim Ryan.\nNow, I'm pretty excited about being here today. And I was especially honored to receive the endorsement of LeBron James. Now, I may become president, but he will be king of Ohio for as long as there is a king. I'm obviously delighted to be endorsed by someone who has demonstrated such leadership and such extraordinary ability. But I'll tell you what really moved me the most is he's given back to his hometown. He has advocated for small businesses, for kids, giving kids more opportunities. He's spoken out on behalf of criminal justice reform. He is someone who uses the platform he has earned because he has worked so hard over so many years to speak out and speak up for those who may not have a voice. So I am truly honored to have his support, and especially to be able to tell people in his hometown how I am looking forward not just to watch him play basketball, but to continue to be a leader in so many different ways.\n\nNow, we do have an important election coming up. Who here is planning to vote? Well, that is very good news because this is the most consequential election, I think, in our lifetimes. The choice could not be clearer, and we need everybody to show up. And how many of you still have to register to be able to vote? Everybody here registered? Well, I want you to talk to your friends because the deadline for registering in Ohio is October 11th. That's just a little over a week away. And if you're not sure whether or not someone you know is registered, or maybe you yourself want to be absolutely positive, you can go to iwillvote.com - see that sign over there? You can go to iwillvote.com and confirm your registration and register if you need to.\n\nSo let's get everybody you know to register and maybe start voting when early voting starts on October the 12th because we have just 36 days left. Thirty-six days, now, we are reaching out. We're making phone calls. We're knocking on doors. If you want to get involved, you can go to my website, hillaryclinton.com. Sign up to be part of this campaign in the next 36 days. You can text 'join,' j-o-i-n, at 47246, and get involved, because we are running to win Ohio in this election.\n\nAnd everybody, everybody in the campaign, is crisscrossing Ohio. My daughter's been here a bunch. Tim Kaine and his wonderful wife Anne have been here. My husband's coming back tomorrow for a two-day bus tour through Ohio. And I will be back because we care about Ohio and we want to make sure Ohio makes the best choice for the future of the people of this great state.\n\nNow, I'm going to close this campaign the way that I started my career a long time ago, fighting for kids and families, standing up for people who may need a little extra boost in life, making sure that this country delivers on the promise of the American dream. See, I believe the American dream is big enough for everybody. If you're willing to work for it and do your part, you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead in America.\n\nNow, my opponent and I have a really different view about what it takes to get ahead and stay ahead, and that may be because we have very different life experiences. And that's okay. People have different families, different views of the world. But here's what I have noticed. I have noticed that he always puts himself first. And maybe that's because he was born into a millionaire family. He started his business with a $14 million loan from his father. His father bailed him out; apparently that's a pattern, you got to be bailed out when you do business with him. And he then has taken advantage of every single element of our tax code, of our economy, that he could.\n\nAnd along the way, along the way, he has stiffed people - small businesses and workers and contractors. And that's part of the reason I take this election so seriously. My dad was a small businessman. My grandfather was a factory worker. And so my dad, when he got out of the Navy in World War II, he started a small business. He started a printing business. He printed fabrics for draperies. And he worked really hard. He had a print plant in Chicago - no natural light, no windows, just a long room where there were two big, long tables, and the fabric would be laid out on them. And then if you've ever seen silkscreens, that's what he did. You take the silkscreen. You put it down. You pour the paint in. You take the squeegee. You go across. You lift it up. You go down to the end of one long table, you start on the end of the other long table. And then, if it was going to be two colors, you would add another color, doing exactly the same thing. It was before there was machines. My dad couldn't have afforded that anyway. But he worked really hard, and he produced a good middle class life for our family.\n\nAnd so when I think about the way that my opponent has taken advantage of people, I got to tell you, I am really grateful my dad never got a contract from him, because I have met people he stiffed. I have met people. I'm talking painters and plumbers. I'm talking dishwashers, marble installers, glass installers, architects, a man who sold him pianos for one of his casinos. He wouldn't pay them. Now, you got to stop and ask yourself, what kind of person does that? Somebody who works hard and has a contract which they expect to be honored.\n\nAnd so I met one of the men. I met a man who had a small family business, installed the glass in one of those casinos, submitted the bill, and Trump said, no. we're not going to pay it. And the man was stunned, as so many hundreds and hundreds of people have been. And then they come back, the Trump organization or Trump himself, and say, okay, we'll give you 10 cents, 20 cents, maybe 30 cents on the dollar. Now, some of those small businesses, they couldn't afford that. They had bought the material, They had provided the services. Trump didn't care. He basically just walked away from them, made them feel like they had failed even though they had done the work they'd been asked to provide. I got to tell you, that is not the way we're supposed to do business in America. And I can't imagine having a president who believes that that's the way you're supposed to treat people. But you're going to help me make sure he never gets near the White House.\n\nNow, earlier today, earlier today in Toledo, I talked about all of the changes I want to make in how we can protect Americans from the kind of corporate fraud that we have seen too much of. Now, the most recent example is Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo actually had people, thousands of their employees, putting customers into accounts they either never asked for or they did not understand. And then every time they put somebody into a new account, they got fees, which then gave them the chance to get a bigger bonus - a really crummy game that hurt people. So thankfully, we have an organization now, the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau in Washington, who looks out for people who get . That is an important part of how we're going to protect. And it's run, you may know, by Richard Cordray from Ohio.\n\nNow, will it surprise you that Donald Trump wants to eliminate that agency? Well, we're not going to let that happen. That agency has already recovered $11 billion for consumers who've been taken advantage of by corporations. And the behavior of Wells Fargo shows clearly that we have got to keep the pressure on these big banks so they can never wreck the economy again the way they did back in 2008.\n\nI have said we're never going to let Wall Street wreck Main Street again, and I mean it. Contrast that - contrast that with my opponent. He wants to do away with the rules that have been imposed on Wall Street. He basically wants to let Wall Street, the banks, the hedge funds, all these other institutions basically do whatever they want again. Well, I'll tell you what, we're not going to let that happen. We need more rules, not fewer rules on them.\n\nI want us to make it easier to start a small business, to get rid of the red tape, to make credit available, to make it clear that most new jobs are going to come from small businesses in America, so we should have a big, dynamic small business economy. But we are not going to let big business and big corporations call the shots anymore. That is not working for us.\n\nBut Trump's whole economic vision is really trickle-down economics. It's the same - the same idea that has failed us before. You see, he believes that all you do is cut taxes on the wealthy and then it trickles down. Well, we know that doesn't work. We've been down that road. And what he wants to do is, I think it's fair to say, trickle-down on steroids. What he has proposed would slash taxes on the wealthy.\n\nNow, I'm a little confused about this because for a long time we've been saying, 'Hey, where are your tax returns?' A lot of us wondered what he was hiding. Because you know, if it was something that would make him look good, he would put them right out there. Everybody who's ever run for president in at least the last 40 years has released their tax returns. My husband and I have about 40 years of tax returns out there. You can go and look at them and you can see that we paid a lot of taxes, and frankly, we were grateful we could. We are grateful for the blessings that we've had over the last 15 years.\n\nSo did any of you see the debate last Monday? Well, I raised it. I said, 'Well, maybe he doesn't want us to see that he owes hundreds of millions of dollars to foreign banks and foreign lenders, or maybe he hasn't paid any taxes.' Now, shortly after the debate, it was discovered that, indeed, back in the 1990s he apparently lost a billion dollars on bad investments and failing casinos. Ask yourself this: Who loses money on casinos? Really. And yesterday some of his supporters said, 'Well, it just shows he's a genius that he didn't pay any taxes.' Well, what kind of genius loses a billion dollars in the first place?\n\nIn the debate, he said not paying taxes made him smart. But think about what that means. It means that all the rest of us who pay our taxes, right - what's he saying about us? But more than that, zero taxes means zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for Pell Grants to send young people to college, zero for health, zero for education. And you stop and ask yourself, this is the same person who's been going around really just dumping on America. He says our military's a disaster. Well, he could not be more wrong, but thank goodness the rest of us paid to support our men and women in uniform who have done so much for us.\n\nToday in Colorado, he claimed he brilliantly used the laws to avoid paying taxes. Well, that just shows, number one, he is the poster boy - the poster boy - for the same rigged system that he would make even worse. Just think about it. He paid zero at least for about 20 years, we believe now based on what we know. And he's advocating for huge tax cuts that would help him and his family even more. What's he want us to do, pay him to lose money? Really?\n\nThere's a lot more to this story, and we're just slowly getting it into the public eye. So we know he's stiffed people, didn't pay his bills. We know he took bankruptcy, depending on how you count, four or six times. You know that he paid no taxes for probably 20 years. We don't know what his taxes would be after that. He's always talked about how he can't release his taxes because he's under audit, but he admitted everything before 2009 is not under audit, so Donald, release everything up until 2009. Show the American people your taxes.\n\nI'll tell you another thing. If I'm fortunate enough to be president, we're going to pass a law requiring anybody who is a nominee of a major national party to have to release their taxes.\n\nSo what did we find out today? Well, a story just came out saying that Donald Trump used Chinese steel and aluminum for two out of the last three construction projects. So instead of buying his steel and aluminum from American plants here in Ohio and Pennsylvania, instead of supporting hardworking families and American jobs, he once again stiffed us. He sent that money overseas.\n\nNow, he spends a lot of time bashing the Chinese, right? You hear that all the time when he talks. Well, it turns out he bought his steel and aluminum from the Chinese. It turns out he owes big money to the Chinese. So this is another one of the episodes of his reality television show, where he is saying one thing and doing something else.\n\nNow, for years, China has been undermining American businesses and workers by illegally dumping cheap aluminum and steel into our markets. You know that, right? And it sounds like Donald Trump has been buying that dumped steel and aluminum. How can he make America great again when he won't even buy American products in our country?\n\nAnd I'll tell you, this is personal to me, because as a senator I went before the International Trade Commission on behalf of steel workers in New York who I represented. And as Secretary of State, I went toe-to-toe with the Chinese. I have put forward an agenda to crack down on trade abuses from countries like China, to stand up for American workers, and to rebuild American infrastructure with American materials like steel and aluminum.\n\nAnd today in Toledo I pointed out, because Chrysler just announced an expansion of the plant there for the new Jeep Wrangler - about 700 more jobs, right? I pointed out when the automobile industry was flat on its back and 850,000 workers in Ohio could have been absolutely out of a job - more than we can even imagine in terms of the long-lasting impact on the economy here - Donald Trump said he didn't care. Save it, don't save it; didn't matter to him.\n\nWell, I'll tell you where I stood. I stood in favor of saving the American automobile industry. And look what we got. Last year, our auto industry had the best year they've had in a really long time. And so we've got to keep building it. We've got to keep making sure that there are good jobs. And we've got to protect good union jobs against the kind of assault that is coming from all sides.\n\nSo now, I know that Ohio is a tough, tough state. You've got to get out there. You've got to talk to people, answer questions, make your case. That's what we've been doing. That's what we're going to do all the way to the end of this election. But I need your help to talk to anybody you know here who thinks they might be voting for Trump. I know you know people. I know you do. And you've got to stage an intervention. You've got to sit them down and point out how everything he says he wants to do is absolutely opposite of what he has done, and how everything he has proposed will help people like him and his family but not the vast majority of families in Ohio. In fact, if you look at his tax proposals, they benefit him and other wealthy people - hedge fund managers and the like, and they would actually raise taxes on middle-class families.\n\nNow, that's the kind of contrast we're getting out in the campaign, but that's why we need your help - to make sure you go out and talk to everybody. And I know people want change. That's part of the American dynamic spirit. We want change. Well, I'll tell you, one thing that is certain is we'll have change - it's just what kind of change. It's whether or not we have change that helps the vast majority of Americans, hardworking Americans, middle-class families, or continues to only help those at the top. I want an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. And that's exactly what we're going to fight for, and that is what we're going to get.\n\nI'll tell you, I've been called a lot of things. Right? I've never been called quitter. If I tell you I'm going to get up every day and fight for you, that is exactly what I will do.\n\nBut I know I can't do it - I can't do it alone. Donald Trump stood on the stage of his convention and just once again painted this dark and dire picture of America. And then he said, 'I alone can fix it.' He gets confused between leadership and dictatorship. He has a hard time remembering who our friends are and who our adversaries are. He has a weird fascination with dictators like Vladimir Putin. We have a lot of people living in this part of Ohio who either themselves or their parents or grandparents came from countries that were under the yoke of oppression, and we're never going to let that happen again.\n\nAnd so when Trump basically signs up for Putin's wish list, that's bad enough. But then, when he's cavalier - and I'm not talking about basketball - when he is cavalier about nuclear weapons, saying that, oh, he doesn't care if other countries get them; in fact, you know, if there were a nuclear war in East Asia, if Japan got nuclear weapons, if South Korea got nuclear weapons, hey, just go at it, folks. He even said he wouldn't care if Saudi Arabia got nuclear weapons. One thing that has been a bedrock of American foreign policy through Democratic and Republican presidents going back to the dawn of the atomic age is we were committed to trying to keep other countries from getting access to nuclear weapons, to be able to stop proliferation. And now it's even more important because it's not only states that we have to worry about, like North Korea; we've got to worry about terrorists getting their hands on nuclear weapons. The last thing we want to do is just act like it doesn't matter, because it does.\n\nI was involved in putting together the sanctions against Iran that drove them to the negotiating table. And what I learned - if you use diplomacy and you're tough about it, you can actually get an agreement that put a lid on their nuclear program. And we're going to make sure they follow it to the period, the comma, everything in that agreement. I'm going to enforce. And we still have challenges with Iran, but I think we're in a stronger position given the fact that they are not racing for a nuclear weapon because we have intrusive inspections.\n\nSo I know diplomacy can work because I've done it, and I know that - we can defeat ISIS and the terrorists if we work with other nations, if we have a coalition that actually takes them out from the air, takes them out on the ground, and fights them online where they are doing so much damage by radicalizing and recruiting young people. I've been laying out my plan for what I think it will take to defeat ISIS, and I have no doubt we will. And Donald says he has a secret plan. That he won't tell us about. Well, there's no secret; he has no plan.\n\nAnd we've got to do more - we've got to do more to make sure we protect our country. We need the best intelligence we can get, the best cooperation among law enforcement at all levels of government. I will not rest. As a former Senator from New York on 9\/11, I take this as a personal responsibility. I will do everything I can to keep our country safe and to work with others to defeat the threat posed by terrorism.\n\nAnd finally, my friends, we've got to bring our country back together. There is too much divisiveness, too much finger-pointing and scapegoating. Our diversity is one of our strengths. We have to listen to each other. We don't have to agree; that is not required. But we need to be respectful. We need to listen. And then we need to roll up our sleeves and get to work.\n\nWhen I was First Lady, Senator, Secretary of State, I worked to find common ground with everybody. I worked when I was First Lady with Republicans and Democrats to create the Children's Health Insurance Program that insures eight million kids. When I was in the Senate, I worked with practically every Republican I served with. And they all have nice things to say about me when I'm not running for something. And I will work again to move our country forward and to change the  of that. And we had to get 13 Republicans, and I worked tirelessly and we got them. We did that. There is a lot we can do if we start listening and respecting each other and avoid the kind of name-calling and insults that we see too much of.\n\nSo I'm excited about the campaign, but I'm even more excited about getting to work for you - being able to get up every day and find a way to try to help somebody. I mean, that is how I was raised in my church and by my family, and that is what I have done through my advocacy work and my legal work on behalf of people who needed a voice. And I will do everything possible to make sure I deliver results for you. And the reason that I have published a book with my great running mate, Tim Kaine - it's right here - is real simple: I want you to know what we say we're going to do, because I want you to hold me accountable. I don't believe in bait and switch, where I say, oh, we're going to do something and then I really am over here doing something else. That kind of reminds you of somebody, doesn't it? No, here's what we're going to try to do. We're going to pay for it by raising taxes on the wealthy and closing loopholes on corporations. And I am the only candidate who ran this whole campaign saying I will never raise taxes on the middle class. That is not going to happen when I am president.\n\nSo please join this campaign in the last 36 days. Talk to your friends. Remember, friends don't let friends vote for Trump. I am motivated every day because now I'm a grandmother - two beautiful grandchildren - and I think about their future, I think about their lives, I think about our country. I want our country to be the land of opportunity. The place where dreams do come true if you're willing to work for them. Not just for my grandchildren, but for every child. I want every child in this country to have a chance to live up to his or her God-given potential. And if you will help me win this election, and then help me work to make it come true, we will have a country that delivers on our dreams and a future we can all be proud of.\n\nThank you and God bless you!\u0000","88":"Hello. It's so great to be back here with all of you tonight. I want to thank my friend, Congressman Jim Clyburn; Don Peebles; Representative Butterfield; members of the Congressional Black Caucus; and congratulate all of the honorees. On a personal note, I want to recognize a dear friend who is retiring after 46 years, Congressman Charles Rangel. He is one of a kind, and we are grateful for your years of service.\nAnd what can I say about one of the best Presidents this country has ever had, Barack Obama? All through this campaign, I have made the point over and over again, Presi-dent Obama saved our country from a second Great Depression. He brought Osama bin Laden to justice. And so much more. I, for one, don't think he gets the credit he deserves for doing what he's done on behalf of our country and the world. And it's not just the President he's been, but the man he is. Even when hateful nonsense is thrown their way, Barack, Michelle, their two beautiful daughters, have represented our country with class, grace, and integrity. As Michelle says, 'When others go low, we go high.' I know I speak for not just everyone in this room but so many tens of millions of Americans: Mr. President, not only do we know you are an American, you're a great American! And you make us all proud to be Americans, too.\n\nLet me thank the leadership of the CBC Foundation for this great honor, and to thank all of my friends in the Congressional Black Caucus for it as well. I dedicate it to all the trailblazers who came before me who blazed trails that I could follow in their footsteps - Barbara Jordan. Shirley Chisholm. I would not be standing here without them. Generations of women and men who struggled and sacrificed and cleared a path for all of us.\n\nThis award is also for everyone out there helping to break down the barriers holding Americans back, to leaders like all of you, and to a rising generation of young activists. To all those on the front lines dedicated to the proposition that in America, every single child deserves the chance to fulfill his or her God-given potential. This has been the cause of my life ever since I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund all those years ago. And I'm going to close my campaign the way I began my career and the way that I will serve as your president, focused on opportunities for our children and fairness for our families.\n\nWe have so much work to do together. I've heard many heartbreaking stories over this campaign. One was from Tianna Gaines-Turner, a working mother to three children from Northeast Philadelphia. She testified at the DNC platform meeting in June and told us how her husband had been laid off and she worked in a part-time job. She said she'd been hungry more times than she could count, and that life felt like a maze, because she faced barriers no matter which way she turned. But despite all of this, Tianna has hope. She still believes that her 8-year-old daughter will be president one day. And she believes that this election can make all the difference in the world to her and her family. Let's prove her right.\n\nAs a country, we have a moral obligation to give her family and every family a chance to rise up and reach their dreams. That is what's at stake in this election. It's not about golf course promotions or birth certificate. It comes down to\n\nwho will fight for the forgotten, who will invest in our children, and who will really have your back in the White House.\n\nWe need ideas, not insults, real plans to help struggling Americans in communities that have been left out and left behind, not prejudice and paranoia. We can't let Barack Obama's legacy fall into the hands of someone who doesn't understand that, whose dangerous and divisive vision for our country will drag us backwards. Instead, we need to come together, to get incomes rising with a higher minimum wage, to invest in neglected communities with efforts like Jim Clyburn's 10-20-30 plan, to get guns out of the hands of dangerous people, to fight for a criminal justice system that actually delivers justice, and to make sure that all kids have good schools and good teachers no matter what zip codes they live in.\n\nWhen you really think about it, the choice this November is about so much more than Democrats and Republicans. As Michelle Obama said at the Democratic convention, it's about who will have the power to shape our children for the next four years of their lives. It's also about the kind of country we want to be, what we want to leave behind for future generations. I thank everyone here, who has been fighting for this vision over so many years. I thank all who have supported me. I want you to know I'm not taking your vote or anyone's vote for granted. I'm working every single day to earn your support. And I need your help over the next 52 days to bring our campaign across the finish line together.\n\nBarbara Jordan famously said that a government is invigorated when each of us is willing to participate in shaping the future of this nation. So to everyone here tonight, please, keep doing what you're doing, but also help to register voters. Tell others about the clear choice in this election. In some states, early voting is nearly here, so we need to keep the pressure on. Let's send a loud and clear message once and for all: We are stronger together. And no matter what, remember this: Love trumps hate. Thank you all very much!\u0000","89":"Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. What a crowd. Wow, look at that. Boy. What a crowd. \nThank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. We just set a record in this building, folks, so that's good news. That's fantastic. Thank you. \n\nI love Michigan, and I must tell you, come November, to be specific, November 8th, with your help, we are going to win and we are going to win big. \n\nAnd we are going to the White House and we are going to bring jobs back to our country and we are going to bring jobs back to Michigan. \n\nIt's going to be a victory for the people, a victory for the wage-earner, the factory worker. Remember this, a big, big victory for the factory worker. They haven't had those victories for a long time. A victory for every citizen and for all of the people whose voices have not been heard for many, many years. They're going to be heard again. \n\nIt'll be a win for the voters, not for the pundits, not for the journalists, not for the lobbyists, not for the global special interests funding my opponent's campaign. \n\nIt's going to be your victory. \n\nThese are hard times for many in this country. I just got back from a tour of the suffering and devastation in Louisiana. Perhaps you can tell by the way I'm dressed. Just got off the plane. It was actually incredible. The spirit of the people is incredible. The devastation, likewise, they've never seen anything like it, but the spirit of the people is incredible. And honestly, Obama ought to get off the golf course and get down there. \n\nWe mourn for the lives lost and we pledge our help, comfort and support to every last person in need. To the people of Louisiana, we are with you and we will always be with you. \n\nIn my vision, I saw not only the suffering of our people but also their strength, courage and really unbeatable spirit. Their spirit will overcome. We have a lot to overcome in our country, especially the fact that our jobs are being taken away from us and going to other lands, and we're not going to allow it to happen, and especially it's happening right here in Michigan. \n\nIt's an amazing spirit that we will need to rebuild our country. It's that strength that we're going to need to create the new American future our children so much deserve. \n\nIn this new -- thank you. Thank you very much. In this new future, millions of workers on the sidelines will be returned to the work force. And if I'm not elected president, that will never happen, believe me. They're talking to you, they're playing you, but believe me, you know the answer.\n\nAnd I have to say that I've been talking about Michigan and the car industry and how your businesses and plants have been ripped out of your land, and I have been doing it for four years to the people of Michigan. Other people started talking about it last week. They're not going to do anything about it.\n\nCrumbling roads, bridges and airports will be replaced with the infrastructure our country needs and deserves. \n\nFamilies strapped in welfare will be provided with jobs and opportunity. Children stuck in failing government schools will be able to attend the school of their choice. \n\nGovernment will become lean, effective, responsible and honest. \n\nOur border will be protected and our children will be safe, very, very safe. \n\nAnd we will build the wall, don't worry about it. We will build the wall. \n\nLaw and order will be restored and the poorest places in our country will know safety and peace again. \n\nAmerican values and cultures will be cherished - and I mean cherished and celebrated once again. But to achieve this new American future, we must break free from the bitter failures of the past, and reject the same insiders telling us the same old lies over and over, and over again. \n\nNo group in America has been more harmed by Hillary Clinton's policies than African-Americans no group. No group. If Hillary Clinton's goal was to inflict pain on the African-American community, she could not have done a better job. It is a disgrace. \n\nTonight I'm asking for the vote of every single African-American citizen in this country who wants to see a better future. \n\nThe inner cities of our country have been run by the Democratic party for more than 50 years. Their policies have produced only poverty, joblessness, failing schools, and broken homes. It's time to hold democratic politicians accountable for what they have done to these communities. At what point do we say enough? \n\nAt what point do we say enough? \n\nIt is time to hold failed leaders accountable for their results, not just their empty words over and over again. Look at what the democratic party has done to the city as an example and there are many others, of Detroit. 40 percent of Detroit's residents, 40 percent, live in poverty. Half of all Detroit residents do not work, and cannot work, and can't get a job\n\nDetroit tops the list of most dangerous cities in terms of violent crime, number one. This is the legacy of the democratic politicians who have run this city. This is the result of the policy agenda embraced by crooked Hillary Clinton. \n\n33,000 e-mails gone. \n\nThe only way to change results is to change leadership. \n\nWe can never fix our problems by relying on the same politicians who created our problems in the first place. A new future requires brand new leadership. \n\nLook at how much African-American communities are suffering from democratic control. To those I say the following, what do you have to lose by trying something new like Trump? What do you have to lose? \n\nI say it again, what do you have to lose? Look, you're living in poverty. Your schools are no good. You have no jobs. 58% of your youth is unemployed. What the hell do you have to lose?\n\nAnd at the end of four years, I guarantee you that I will get over 95% of the African American vote. I promise you. Because I will produce, I will produce for the inner cities and I will produce for the African Americans. And the Democrats will not produce and all they have done is taken advantage of your vote. That's all they've done. And once the election is over, they go back to their palaces in Washington. And you know what? They do nothing for you. Just remember it.\n\nSo, you have nothing to lose. One thing we know for sure: if you keep voting for the same people you will keep getting the same, exactly the same, results.\n\nMy administration will go to work for you as no one has ever done before.\n\nWe will work. We will bring back jobs. We will work.\n\nBy contrast, the one thing every item in Hillary Clinton's agenda has in common is that it takes jobs and opportunities away from African American workers.\n\nIt takes jobs away from all workers because your companies are leaving Michigan. Your companies are leaving every single state in our union. They're going to Mexico. They're going everywhere but here.\n\nHillary Clinton supports open borders. Which means many things but it means people pouring and they take your jobs.\n\nWhether you like it or don't like it. They take your jobs.\n\nHer fierce opposition to school choice. You need choice. You have to get your children into good schools. You do that through competition. You need choice.\n\nHer plan to massively raise taxes on small business and everyone. $1.3 trillion tax increase. Where as I am cutting taxes very substantively for business and for the middle class.\n\nHer tremendous opposition to American energy. Her opposition is fierce and her record of giving our jobs away to many many other countries. America must reject the bigot dream of Hillary Clinton who sees communities of color only as votes, not as human beings worthy of a better future.\n\nHillary Clinton would rather provide a job to a refugee from overseas that to give that job to unemployed African American youth in cities like Detroit, who have become refugees in their own country.\n\nIt's time to get our country back to work and that includes an all out effort. To help young African Americans get the good paying jobs that they deserve.\n\nHillary Clinton's plan would bring in an estimated 620,000 refugees in her first term at a lifetime benefit cost of some $400 billion to our country. According to the Senate Immigration Subcommittee.\n\nHillary Clinton wants to be America's Angela Merkel. By the way, for the price of supporting one refugee in the United States, we could support 12 in a safe zone in the Middle East or let's say Syria.\n\nThe approved refugee screening standards that I have proposed will save countless, billions of dollars. It's called extreme vetting. Extreme vetting. \n\nWe will invest a portion of the money saved in the jobs program for inner city youth. The African American community has given so much to this country. They fought and died in every war since the Revolution.\n\nThey've lifted up the conscience of our nation in the long march towards civil rights. They've sacrificed so much for the national good. Yet, nearly 4 in 10 African Americans children still live in poverty and 58%, as I said, of African Americans are not working.\n\nThey cannot find a job.\n\nWe must do better as a country. I refuse to believe that the future must be like the past. It won't be. Our future will be a great future for everyone. For everyone. \n\nIn a Trump administration, all workers of all colors will get priorities for jobs in their own country which is about time.\n\nI want higher wages for African Americans, for Hispanic Americans, and for all Americans. We want higher wages \n\nMany, many workers in our country are making substantially less money today in real wages than they made 18 years ago.\n\nThey're working two jobs instead of one. They're working much harder as they get older and it's supposed to be the opposite.\n\nWe're gonna stop it. We're going to create great jobs and we're gonna get the wages up.\n\nHillary Clinton, is a throwback to an ugly past where politicians preyed on our poorest citizens while selling them out for personal gain. Promises, promises, all talk no action. All talk, no action politicians.\n\nThey talk, talk, talk. You vote them in with great fan fare and then they just do nothing.\n\nWith Trump, that is not going to happen. Believe me.\n\nWe must turn the page on yesterday, only a change in leadership will produce a change in outcomes. And we can't take, as a country, four more years of Obama. And that's what you get with Hillary Clinton but probably worse.\n\nIn this new American future, American workers will always come first. America first, always come first.\n\nThis will include a complete revitalization of the Michigan manufacturing sector. Now, you have to understand, the Michigan manufacturing sector is a disaster. Is a disaster.\n\nLook at your notes, look at your stats, look at what's happening to your state. You're losing your businesses. It's like taking candy away from a baby. And many people right now in this audience that think you have jobs, you're gonna find out very soon that your company is leaving from Mexico or some other place and you're not going to have your job for very long.\n\nAnd if Trump gets in, those days are over folks, they're over \n\nWe will be brining back our jobs to Michigan. There will be a very big price to pay for those companies that wanna leave our land, go someplace else, manufacture their goods, and sell back with no retribution.\n\nIt won't happen. There will be consequence. Won't happen. It will not happen.\n\nMichigan lost more than 1 in 4 of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA.\n\nAs you know, NAFTA, one of the worst trade bills in history maybe, maybe the worst trade bill signed in the history of the world. Not only in our country. Its emptied out Michigan, its emptied out New England. Its emptied out New York State. Its emptied out so many of our great companies.\n\nThey leave and they fire. We end up with devastation. We end up with unemployment. We end up with nothing.\n\nThe bill was signed by Bill Clinton. \n\nIt was supported by Hillary Clinton. \n\nRight here in this community, you have lost 1 in 7 manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton put China into the World Trade Organization. Another Hillary Clinton back deal. She backs all the deals.\n\nAnd by the way, she will be backing Trans Pacific Partnership. TPP. If she is elected. Just mark your words. Just remember, you know it's gonna happen.\n\nShe considered it the gold standard. All of a sudden when she heard me talking about it, she said \"I can't win this one\" so she went against it. She will go back immediately, and you saw that when the governor of Virginia, who's her friend, said that was going to happen.\n\nDetroit lost more than 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs following the NAFTA and WTO agreements. That was supported very strongly by my opponent.\n\nNo industry, has been hurt more by Hillary Clinton's policies than the automobile industry or as we call it the car industry. It has been a total disaster.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of the Labor of Statistics, before NAFTA went into effect, there were 285,000 auto workers in Michigan. Today, that number is down to only 160,000 and it is going to be a lot lower because if you look at the massive plants being built right now in Mexico, car plants, folks, you can kiss these jobs goodbye. \n\nBut not me. Not with me. It won't happen. \n\nIn 2014, General Motors announced plans to double its investments in Mexico by plans by 2018. Not good. \n\nIn April 2016, Ford Motor Company announced plans to invest another $1.6 billion constructing an auto plant in Mexico. Mexico will become the car capital of the world very, very quickly. And Michigan is going to end up with lots of empty buildings all over the place unless you elect Donald Trump president. In which case, it's not gonna happen. \n\nIn same month, Fiat Chrysler announced 1,300 layoffs. The list goes on and on. We will turn it around, we will turn it around fast. We will meet with these companies and we will say, it will not be easy for you to move your plant to Mexico for you sell your cars through what will be a very strong border, and for you not to pay tax on those cars coming in, okay? \n\nAnd when we tell them that there will be a substantial tax on the cars that they make in Mexico and other places, number one, they're not going to move in the first place, and number two, if they do, our country will make one heck of a lot of money. \n\nBut to save your jobs and do all of the things that I'm talking about, we have to win on November 8th. \n\nThe destruction that NAFTA started will be finished off if the Transpacific Partnership is approved. It will be almost, nothing is as bad as NAFTA, but it will be almost as bad as NAFTA.\n\nWe know from Hillary's closest friend, that she is planning to ram through TPP if she's elected. She even called it, as I said, the gold standard. Its passage would be a disaster for Michigan, in particular, for the car industry in particular, for the people of Michigan. I won't let it happen. \n\nAccording to the Economic Policy Institute, the United States trade deficit with the proposed TPP member countries cost over one million manufacturing jobs in our country in 2015. By far the biggest losses occurred in motor vehicles and parks, which lost nearly 740,000 think of that 740,000 manufacturing jobs. Michigan ranks first for jobs lost as a share of state workforce due to trade deficit with TPP members.\n\nJust imagine how many more automobile jobs will be lost if Hillary gets her wish and approves TPP. It will not be pretty. That's why I have announced that we will withdrawal from the deal before that deal can ever, ever, ever happen. \n\nI have have previously laid out a detailed seven-point plan for trade reform, available on my website. It includes strong protections against currency manipulation from countries like China and tariffs against any nation that cheats by unfairly subsidizing their goods, of which many of them do. \n\nMy plan also includes a total renegotiation of NAFTA so our jobs can come back. \n\nAnd if we can't make a much, much better deal than we have right now, we will walk. \n\nI'm not in any way, shape or form an isolationist. I don't believe in it, but we have to make great deals for our country. We're losing in our whole trade negotiation with all countries over $800 billion a year. That's our trade deficit. Who negotiates these deals? We want great trade deals and we will have them. \n\nBut we want trade deals that work for America, that create jobs and wealth for our country, that work for the American worker. \n\nWe want to shrink our almost $800 billion trade deficit. We don't want to expand it, and it's been expanding for years. For years and years. You look at the charts up, up, up, up, up. And I say to myself so often, why don't they do something about it? And the reason is we have political hacks as our negotiators.\n\nWe have politicians as our negotiators. We have politicians that are controlled like Hillary Clinton by her donors, her special interests and her lobbyists and they won't let her do what's right for our workers and for our country.\n\nWe want to be leading the world in production, exports and manufacturing. We want jobs to leave from other countries and come into our country for a change. \n\nAnother major issue in this race is foreign policy. Hillary Clinton has made one bad foreign policy decision after another. Beginning with the support for going to war in Iraq, and I opposed it so strongly.\n\nNobody cared. I was a civilian, but I opposed it. I said you will have a total destabilization of the Middle East. It was such common sense and look what happened. Her tenure as secretary of State may be regarded as the most disastrous in United States history. But she is totally without remorse. Her failed decisions as secretary of State unleashed ISIS onto the world. \n\nBut has she ever apologized for the death and destruction she has caused? No.\n\nLook at the world before and after she became Secretary of State. Pre-Hillary in the early 2009s, Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence. Libya was somewhat stable. Syria was under control. The group we now know today, ISIS, was close to being extinguished. Iran was being choked by sanctions.\n\nNow, take a look at what we have. Fast forward to the present time.\n\nAfter Hillary, here is what it looks like. Iraq is in total chaos. Syria is in the midst of a disastrous civil war. A refugee crisis now threatens Europe and the United States, where we're taking in thousands and thousands and thousands of people. ISIS has been unleashed unto the entire world.\n\nIran, the world's top state sponsor of terrorism has been put on the path to nuclear weapons, was given $400 million in ransom payment cash \n\nVery much like you can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan, Obamacare a total disaster. It will be repealed. It will be replaced. \n\nHillary Clinton is a legacy of death, destruction, and terrorism. America deserves a better legacy.\n\nAll of you deserve a much, much, better future.\n\nI am the change agent. I am the change agent. \n\nI am your messenger. And I said it many times, I'm nothing more than your messenger. It's a message of strong defense, common sense, take care of our vets, great education, get rid of Common Core, great health care, get rid of Obamacare, save our Second Amendment. \n\nWhich is under tremendous siege right now.\n\nHillary Clinton is the defender of the status quo or what we have. While our country lost badly under Hillary Clinton, she cashed in big time. Our country was losing. Our people were losing, but she is cashing in.\n\nBill Clinton's speaking fees surged while Hillary was Secretary of State. He was paid almost $50 million for speeches during her tenure, an increase in 44 percent over the previous four years.\n\nBy the way, things came out today that blow everything away today. Then there was all of the money funneled into the Clinton Foundation from foreign governments and corporations. It was pay for play. \n\nYet, Hillary Clinton, who is indifferent to the suffering she has caused, has no remorse at all. She offers no apologies. No apologies for unleashing ISIS. No apologies for her open borders. No apologies for lying about her e-mails or about Benghazi. \n\nThe only way to learn the full depth of her public corruption is to read the 33,000 e-mails that she deleted.\n\nAnd the only way to get justice in this rigged system is to show up and vote on November 8th and vote big, big, big. \n\nAnd I will bring your jobs back. So are you ready to vote?\n\nAnd what about your future? Is it going to be great, good, or terrible?\n\nGreat. So if you're ready to vote for honest government and the honest government that you deserve, a Trump administration will end the corruption and restore integrity to government service. Remember, I'm funding my campaign, I'm spending tremendous amounts of money on running for office.\n\nI'm raising money for the Republican Party and the Republican National Committee, which I think is doing a very good job, but I'll tell you more about that on November 8th. I'll let you know if they do a good job or if they do not such a good job. But I think they're going to do a great job.\n\nNo one will be above the law in a Trump administration. The State Department will work for the country, not for Hillary Clinton's donors. \n\nAnd I will work for you and I will work for no one else. I will work for you. I will never lie to you. I will never put any other interests before you and I will never, ever stop fighting for you. Never. \n\nThe government will work for the people again. That means we are only going to admit individuals into our country who support our values and we're not going to issue visas where adequate screening controls take place. We are going to make sure that we have total screening, and without it, we cannot continue to have our government run like this. We will also seek to join in partnership with any nation that wishes to join us in defeating and destroying ISIS. \n\nAt home, taxes will go down, especially for look, I mean, it's going to go down for a lot of people, for business they're going down, businesses are going to flourish, they're going to come pouring back. But taxes will go down, especially for middle-income Americans. \n\nAnd small business rates will be lowered to 15 percent so we can put millions of new jobs into our poorest neighborhoods. \n\nAs I said, Obamacare will be repealed and replaced. Voters, not special interests, will be in charge finally. We are going to bring our country together again. We have a divided country. It's totally divided. The era of division will be replaced with a future of unity, total unity. We will love each other. We will have one county. Everybody will work together. \n\nWe are going to do it by emphasizing what we all have in common as Americans. It's time to break with the failures of the past and to fight for every last child in this country to have the better future they deserve. \n\nIn my administration, every American will be treated equally, protected equally and honored equally. We will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms and seek a new future built on our common culture and values as one American people. \n\nThis is the change I am promising to all of you; an honest government with low taxes, a thriving economy and a just society for each and every American. It's time to vote for a new American future. \n\nTogether, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America united again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again and we will make America great again. God bless you. \n\nThank you. Thank you very much, Michigan. Thank you.\u0000","90":"The Hillary Clinton documents released by WikiLeaks make more clear than ever just how much is at stake in this election. This election will determine whether we remain a free country, or we become a corrupt Banana Republic controlled by large donors and foreign governments.\nThe election of Hillary Clinton would lead to the destruction of our country.\n\nToday we learned the Department of Justice fed information to the Clinton campaign about the e-mail investigation, so that the campaign could be prepared to cover up her crimes. This is collusion and corruption of the highest order, and is one more reason why I will ask my Attorney General to appoint a special prosecutor. We have to investigate the investigation.\n\nHillary bleached and deleted 33,000 emails after a congressional subpoena - and then destroyed her phones with a hammer - all to cover-up her crimes. People have gone to jail for doing far less. She also lost as much as $6 billion taxpayer dollars.\n\nThese Wikileaks emails confirm what those of us here today have known all along: Hillary Clinton is the vessel for a corrupt global establishment that is raiding our country and surrendering our sovereignty. This criminal government cartel doesn't recognize borders, but believes in global governance, unlimited immigration, and rule by corporations.\n\n...\n\nEven Chelsea Clinton, the WikiLeaks emails show, expressed \"serious concerns\" about conflicts of interests at the Clinton Foundation and State Department.\n\nDuring a recent trip to Florida, I had a chance to spend some time with the incredible residents of Little Haiti. The Haitian community has contributed so much to this country. I also learned from them, firsthand, how much they despise the Clintons for what they did to the people of Haiti.\n\nNew emails revealed today by ABC News show that during the deadly earthquake in Haiti, which killed over 150,000 people, the Clintons couldn't stop cashing in. As people were dying in Haiti, Clinton insiders were separating out requests from \"Friends of Bill\" or \"William Jefferson Clinton VIPs\" so that their business interests or contracts would receive special treatment.\n\nPeople who were labeled \"Not Friends of Bill\" were placed on the sidelines.\n\nIn their biggest project, the Clintons used $400 million in aid and U.S. taxpayer funds to build what amounted to a sweatshop. And guess who set it up? Cheryl Mills, Hillary's Chief of Staff who helped destroy her emails, and then got an immunity deal from the FBI that included the destruction of her computer.\n\nThe company that benefitted from Mills' actions then invested in a company owned by Cheryl Mills.\n\nToday, as Haiti's death toll from Hurricane Matthew is on the rise, we should never forget how Bill and Hillary Clinton handled Haiti last time.\n\nTo all of our friends in Haiti, your day of justice is coming, and it arrives on November 8th.\n\nNot only have the Clintons ripped off Haiti, but the new emails show members of the Clinton team attacking Catholics. This is deeply offensive. It's just the latest evidence of the hatred that the Clinton Campaign has for everyday Americans. We've all read the reports and heard the stories about how disrespectfully she treats law enforcement, secret service, and others in uniform. She even smeared all of America's police officers as essentially racist.\n\nI'm proud of the fact that I have always treated the working people of this country with dignity and respect, especially our military and law enforcement personnel.\n\nThe WikiLeaks emails show that Hillary's staff even has to give her secret notes on when she needs to smile.\n\nThe emails also show, yet again, that the DNC rigged the Democratic election to give it to Hillary Clinton. The DNC Vice Chair was caught feeding information about Bernie Sanders' plans to the Clinton Campaign.\n\nTo all the Bernie voters out there: don't vote for a Wall Street sellout like Hillary Clinton. A vote for Hillary is a vote for more reckless foreign invasions, more Wall Street cheating, more terrible trade deals, and - as confirmed by Wikileaks - she also wants to cut Medicare and Social Security.\n\n...\n\nWikileaks also shows something I have been warning about for a very long time. The media is simply an extension of the Clinton Campaign. It's just one more way the system is rigged.\n\nReporters who work for these outlets - like the Washington Post, or the New York Times - may think of themselves as journalists, but they are actually just cogs in a corporate political machine.\n\nThe emails show the New York Times, Boston Globe, Univision and Jon Harwood of CNBC all doing favors for the Clintons, and smother the Clintons with praise. The NYT even gave Clinton veto power of her quotes in their stories. It's called corruption.\n\nThe emails also show that the Hillary was given the CNN townhall questions before her big debate against Bernie Sanders. Dona Brazile, the DNC Vice Chair, emailed: \"from time to time I get the questions in advance.\"\n\nThe media can't report on the establishment because the media is the establishment. And they're all teamed up against you, the American people.\n\n...\n\nOn November 8th, the arrogance of Washington D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.\n\nWe are going to replace our corrupt global establishment that has failed us on borders, on trade, on foreign policy, on the economy, and so much more. We are going to replace the failed leadership in Washington who have betrayed you, squandered our wealth, and sold our country.\n\nI am asking all Americans - Republicans, Independents and Democrats - to join us in our campaign to give our government back to the American people.\n\nI am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation - and I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.\n\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\n\nYou're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this day. This is a movement like you've never seen before. We're going to make history together. You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote I've ever cast for anyone at any time.\n\nA vote for me is a vote for change, and a vote for me is really a vote for you. Once again, we are going to have a government of, by and for the people.\n\nWe will make America wealthy again.\n\nWe will make America strong again.\n\nWe will make America safe again.\n\nAnd we are going to make America great again.\u0000","91":"Thank you. I am honored to be here today. Let me extend my special gratitude to General Ashenhurst and General Hargett, and to each and every one of you.\nThe National Guard of the United States has defended this nation at war, kept our citizens safe at home, and rushed into danger wherever it has threatened our people.\n\nOur debt to you is eternal.\n\nYesterday was the 15th anniversary of the 9\/11 attacks. The National Guard was sent to assist in the aid and recovery efforts at Ground Zero in New York City.\n\nSince 9\/11, there have been 780,000 members of the National Guard deployed overseas - including those with multiple deployments. Right now, 10,000 members of the National Guard are in Iraq, Afghanistan, and many other countries across the world.\n\nMembers of the National Guard come from all walks of life, work in every kind of job imaginable, and juggle a thousand different challenges as they raise their kids, serve their states, and answer the call of duty for their country.\n\nIf I am given the honor to serve as your President, I will pledge to give you the resources, the equipment, and the support you need and deserve.\n\nYou will have a true and loyal friend in the White House.\n\nWhether you vote for me, or whether you vote for someone else, I will be your greatest champion. I will not let you down.\n\nI am running to be a President for all Americans - and I've been especially humbled to have the support of so many of our men and women in uniform.\n\nAll across this country, I've met so many incredible members of both our military and law enforcement community. There's nothing I've enjoyed more than the time I've spent with our service members, police officers, and also our firefighters and paramedics.\n\nThey embody the goodness and decency of our country.\n\nI was thus deeply shocked and alarmed this Friday to hear my opponent attack, slander, smear and demean these wonderful, amazing people who are supporting our campaign.\n\nOur support comes from every part of America, and every walk of life. We have the support of cops and soldiers, carpenters and welders, the young and the old, and millions of working class families who just want a better future.\n\nThese were the people Hillary Clinton so viciously demonized. These were among the countless Americans that Hillary Clinton called deplorable, irredeemable and un-American. She called these patriotic men and women every vile name in the book - she called them racist, sexist, xenophobic, and Islamaphobic.\n\nShe called them a \"basket of deplorables\" in both a speech and an interview. She divides people into baskets as though they were objects, not human beings.\n\nHillary Clinton made these comments at one of her high-dollar fundraisers in Wall Street.\n\nShe and her wealthy donors all had a good laugh. They were laughing at the very people who pave the roads she drives on, paint the buildings she speaks in, and keep the lights on in her auditorium.\n\nHillary Clinton is an insider, supported by powerful insiders, attacking Americans who have no political power.\n\nHillary Clinton spoke with hatred and derision for the people who make this country run.\n\nShe spoke with contempt for the people who thanklessly follow the rules, pay their taxes, and scratch out a living for their families.\n\nWhile Hillary Clinton lives a sequestered life behind gates and walls and guards, she mocks and demeans hardworking Americans who only want their own families to enjoy a fraction of the security enjoyed by our politicians.\n\nAfter months of hiding from the press, Hillary Clinton has revealed her true thoughts.\n\nShe revealed herself to be a person who looks down on the proud citizens of our country as subjects for her to rule over.\n\nHer comments displayed the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as Secretary of State, hide and delete her emails, put classified information in the reach of our enemies, lie to Congress, and sell government favors and access through her Foundation.\n\nIt's the same attitude that explains why Hillary Clinton refuses to take accountability for the deadly disasters she helped to create in Iraq, in Syria and in Libya.\n\nTo this day, she still won't take accountability for her role in unleashing ISIS across the Middle East - or for putting Iran on the path to a nuclear weapon.\n\nHillary Clinton believes she is above the law, that she is above accountability, and that she is above each and every one of you.\n\nOur campaign is about giving voice to the voiceless. It's about representing the forgotten men and women of this country.\n\nI'm here to represent everyone, but especially those who are struggling against injustice and unfairness.\n\nI am running so that the powerful can no longer beat up on the powerless. I'm running to take on the special interests, the big donors, and the corrupt political insiders.\n\nI am running to be your voice.\n\nHillary Clinton is a voice for Wall Street, for hedge fund managers, for the top tenth of the one percent. Just look at the people funding Hillary Clinton's campaign, and paying for her speeches, and you'll know who she represents.\n\nThe disdain that Hillary Clinton expressed towards millions of decent Americans disqualifies her from public service.\n\nYou cannot run for President if you have such contempt in your heart for the American voter. You can't lead this nation if you have such a low opinion of its citizens.\n\nHillary Clinton still hasn't apologized to those she slandered. In fact, she hasn't backed down at all - she's doubled-down on her campaign of conspiracy and contempt.\n\nIf Hillary Clinton will not retract her comments in full, then I don't see how she can credibly campaign.\n\nLet's be clear. These were not offhand comments from Hillary Clinton. These were not stray remarks in an interview, or an accidental choice of words. These were lengthy, planned, and prepared remarks - it was perhaps the most explicit attack on the American voter ever spoken by a major-party presidential nominee.\n\nClinton was using a very deliberate page from the Democratic Playbook - smearing someone with one of those names in order to scare them out of voting for change. She just took it to a whole new level by applying it to tens of millions of people.\n\nShe used these vile words in order to bully and intimidate honest citizens out of seeking government reform.\n\nPeople who want their immigration laws enforced, and their borders secured, are not racists. They are patriotic Americans of all backgrounds who want their jobs and families protected.\n\nPeople who warn about Radical Islamic Terrorism are not Islamophobes. They are decent American citizens who want to uphold our tolerant values and keep our country safe.\n\nPeople who support the police, and who want crime reduced, are not prejudiced. They are concerned and loving citizens whose hearts break every time an innocent child is lost to preventable violence.\n\nHillary Clinton doesn't have to worry about Sanctuary Cities, or jobs moving overseas. She's protected from her own policies.\n\nThe policies of Hillary Clinton have produced failing schools, shrinking incomes, and the tragic poverty and joblessness in our inner cities.\n\nOur campaign is dedicated to changing these policies to make life better for all Americans.\n\nWe are the campaign of school choice.\n\nWe are the campaign dedicated to improving economic conditions for every African-American and Hispanic worker.\n\nWe are the campaign that will deliver a government of, by and for the people.\n\nThis change agenda includes a new foreign and military policy.\n\nWe are going to put the failed policies of the past behind us.\n\nWe will empower our generals to do the job they were hired to do - and that begins with defeating and destroying ISIS.\n\nInstead of endless wars, we want a real plan for victory.\n\nWe will abandon the policy of reckless regime change favored by my opponent, and we will instead work with our allies to advance the core national security interests of the United States.\n\nMy plan calls for a major rebuilding of the entire military, and the elimination of the defense sequester. In this rebuilding, we will provide our National Guard with the best, modern state-of-the-art equipment in the world.\n\nThe National Guard is often the first and the last line of defense for our people.\n\nYou are there when the hurricanes and floods and tornadoes strike.\n\nYou are there to protect civilians in times of unrest.\n\nYou are there to respond to every natural disaster.\n\nYou deserve a government that recognizes and honors your contribution, and that ensures you have the resources you need to get the job done.\n\nIn a Trump Administration, the National Guard will always have a direct line to the Oval Office.\n\nYou will have an Administration that never loses sight of the vital contribution you make each and every day.\n\nYou will have a President who supports, promotes and speaks up for the National Guard at every turn.\n\nThe members of the National Guard have sacrificed life and limb for our freedom, our safety and our country.\n\nWe will never forget our heroes, their families, and the ones they've left behind.\n\nOur gratitude is everlasting.\n\nWe will protect those who protect us.\n\nAnd we will follow your example of unity - working in common purpose and common cause.\n\nWe will be one people, under one God, saluting one American flag.\n\nWe will rebuild our military - and our country.\n\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\n\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\n\nAnd We Will Make America Great Again.\n\nThank you, and God Bless you all.\u0000","92":"Thank you! Whoa! Thank you so much. And I am so happy to be here in Coral Springs, in Broward County, in the great state of Florida! And I know there's a big overflow crowd in the next building over. I think they can see and hear us, but I wanted to thank them for being part of today's event.\n\nAnd I've got to recognize Joshua Simmons, who just introduced me. He is a civics teacher at Pompano Beach Middle School, and boy, are his students lucky to have him and his enthusiasm. And I want to also commend him for talking about his mother and how hard she worked, and his sister who he helped to raise. We really are stronger together, and that starts in families and neighborhoods and communities.\n\nWell, you heard from a lot of my friends who represent you, starting with my great friend and former colleague, your Senator Bill Nelson. And I am looking forward to working with Bill as we make sure to continue the progress that will move us all forward together. And I sure hope Florida sends some reinforcements to the Senate and elect Congressman Patrick Murphy. I think Florida deserves a full-time senator, don't you? And I want to thank my friend, someone who has just worked her heart out not just for her constituents but for Democrats across America - Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. And another great friend of mine going back more years than we care to remember - I'm so pleased he's here with us - Congressman Alcee Hastings. And I know that Congressman Ted Deutch, who represents this district - is over in Israel for the funeral of a great, great man, Shimon Peres, and I want to thank Ted for all of his support and his hard work.\n\nBefore I get started and really talk about everything that's at stake and what we have to do the next 39 days to make sure we win this election, I wanted to say a few words about the tragic passing of Jose Fernandez. When he left Cuba, he did not speak a word of English. He didn't let that stop him. He pursued his dreams. He wanted to and he became one of the best baseball players that Miami has ever seen. And he never forgot where he came from. He worked hard to give back to the community that had given so much to him. Jose's life really embodied the American dream, and at 24 years of age, he was just getting started. I'm sure you join me in saying that our thoughts and our prayers are with his family, with his fans, and everyone whose life he touched during his extraordinary career.\n\nI also want to mention another resident of Coral Springs, and that's a man named Bob Levinson. My heart goes out to Bob's family. He disappeared in Iran more than nine years ago, and it is long past time for the Iranian regime to provide us information about his whereabouts and let him return home to his family.\n\nNow, did any of you see the debate the other night? Well, I think it was pretty clear there are two very different choices for our country based on two very different visions of the kind of America that we want to have. My view is we are already great, and if we work together, we will become even greater in the years ahead. I believe America is an exceptional nation. My opponent believes America is in decline. I've never heard such a dark and divisive, terrible image of our country coming from someone running to be president of the United States. When he talks, I lots of times don't even recognize the country he's talking about. And why are we already great? Well, it is not just because of the size of our economy or the size of our military. It is because of our generosity; it is because of our ingenuity; it is because of the diversity of our country. I think our diversity is one of our strongest assets.\n\nThis morning, I laid out my plan for more national service so that more people of all ages can serve America, serve their communities. Because America is great, when you really strip it all down, because America is good. And we can't ever forget that.\n\nI have laid out specific plans about how we're going to make our country even greater. I've actually got a book here with Tim Kaine, my running mate. I have this old-fashioned idea: if I'm asking you for your vote for president, I should tell you what I'm going to do. I shouldn't just talk in generalities and use rhetoric and never answer questions about what we can do, but to lay out how we're going to make the economy work for everyone, not just those at the top.\n\nThat means new jobs - new jobs with rising incomes, jobs in infrastructure, jobs in advanced manufacturing, in innovation and technology, and yes, clean, renewable energy jobs.\n\nMy opponent's only infrastructure plan is to build a wall. I love that he went down to Mexico and he choked. He didn't even raise it. He's been going around telling people for months, 'We're going to build a wall and we're going to make Mexico pay for it.' So he's sitting with the president of Mexico and he doesn't even bring it up. He finds it a lot easier to insult women than to talk to the president of Mexico about building a wall. I mean, really, who gets up at 3 o'clock in the morning to engage in a Twitter attack against a former Miss Universe? I mean, he hurled as many insults as he could. Really, why does he do things like that? I mean, his latest Twitter meltdown is unhinged, even for him. It proves yet again that he is temperamentally unfit to be president and commander-in-chief. I have said it before and I'll say it again: A man who can be provoked by a tweet should not be anywhere near the nuclear codes.\n\nSo I'm going to keep talking about what we can do together after this election. Getting those new jobs. And I'll tell you, another area I want to emphasize is small business. As I said the other night, my dad was a small businessman. He made a lot of sacrifice and he worked really hard to give us a good, solid, middle-class life. I'm really proud of that. And I'm sure glad he never got a contract from Donald Trump, who stiffs small businesses, doesn't pay his bills to people like my dad. But we need to do more to get small business started and growing - here in Broward County, throughout South Florida, across the state, and beyond.\n\nSo as we grow the economy, we also have to make it fairer. I want prosperity to reach everyone, not just the privileged few. So we are going to raise the minimum wage be-cause if you work full-time, you should not still be in poverty. And you know, two-thirds of all minimum wage workers are women, most of them supporting kids. And if you work full-time on a minimum wage job, at the end of the year you've made $15,000. I think we can do better. And I think we should because we want everybody to have a chance to get ahead and stay ahead and go as far as their hard work and talent will take them.\n\nSomething else we're going to do is we are finally going to guarantee equal pay for women's work. Now, this is not, my friends, just a women's issue. If you have a mother, a wife, a daughter, a sister, who is working, it's your issue, too, to make sure she is paid fairly. That will raise family incomes.\n\nAnd then the third thing I want to do is to make sure - to make sure - more companies share profits with the workers who helped to create those profits in the first place. The other night at the debate, one of my guests was Mark Cuban. He was sitting in the front row. And one of the reasons I was proud to have him there is he believes in profit-sharing. He's always, in his companies, shared profits. And by the way, he is a real billionaire. And when he sold his first company, he shared the profits from the sale and 300 people who worked for him, who helped to make him a success, became millionaires. I want to lift up and use as examples business leaders like that, not somebody who stiffs contractors, who doesn't pay dishwashers and painters and plumbers and glass installers and architects and marble installers and so many else, but somebody who has the right attitude, that we're stronger together in business just like we are in government and America.\n\nAnd the other thing we have to do more of is to make sure that we help deal with some of the stresses that American families are facing. It is hard to balance family and work, isn't it? I think we can do better. I want to see us have paid family leave, earned sick days, affordable childcare, and affordable college that includes tuition-free and debt-free college.\n\nNow, after the primary was over - and Senator Sanders and I ran a tough primary, but you know what? I was really proud. We ran a campaign based on issues, not insults. He and I got together and we said, okay, what are we going to do to make sure that more young people can actually get a college education? Because right now, it's way beyond what a lot of families can afford. And if you go into debt, you come out of it with so much debt that remains a burden on you.\n\nSo the other day Senator Sanders and I were up in New Hampshire together, and we were rolling out our plan. And it's pretty simple. You can go to my website, but let me just tell you briefly. If you are in a family that makes less than $125,000, you will not pay tuition to go to a public college or university. And if you make more than that, you will pay what you can afford, but you will not have to borrow money because it will be debt-free for you to go. And we put together a calculator on my website. You can go to hillaryclinton.com\/ calculator and you can see how much you will save, how much your child or your grandchild would save under this plan.\n\nBut I also believe a four-year college degree, which is an important part of getting an education to get ahead, should not leave you mired in debt. So we are going to help you refinance your debt, get the interest rates down, and if you're willing to do public service, national service, we're going to forgive your debt over time.\n\nBut not everyone has to go for a four-year degree. I want every person, not just young people but people who are looking for a different opportunity or may have to retrain - I want to everybody to have a chance for a good, solid job. I think we made a mistake when we took vocational education out of high school. We need to put technical education back into high school.\n\nAnd we need to make sure that community colleges are free so that young people starting in high school can take courses at community college to get the training they need for a good job. And I want to see business and labor unions working together for real apprenticeship programs - not the kind that lead to being told, 'You're fired,' the kind that lead to being told, 'You're hired.'\n\nNow, I'm excited about this. I really am. I am confident and optimistic about our country. We never get anything done if all we do is get down in the mouth and feel bad and complain and try to blame somebody for something else. That's not who we are as Americans. We need to lift ourselves up, and we need to roll up our sleeves to get to work to make sure that future is what it should be for our country.\n\nAnd while we're doing that, we're going to make sure that our country's safe and that America provides strong and steady leadership around the world. Sometimes, when I listen to my opponent, it kind of seems he doesn't know who our friends are versus our adversaries. He has this weird fascination with dictators. He's kind of signed up for the Vladimir Putin wish list. He doesn't care whether NATO falls apart, and he is really cavalier about other countries getting nuclear weapons. He said he doesn't care. Let Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia, get a nuclear weapon. Whoa! That's the kind of dangerous, reckless talk that people around the world pay attention to.\n\nAs I told him in the debate - he actually said, 'Well, we may or may not defend our allies in Asia.' Words matter. And America's word matters. We have to be reliable and trustworthy. People have to count on us. And we've got a lot of work to do around the world. We need to work hard for peace and prosperity. We need to tackle climate change together.\n\nClimate change is real. Florida knows that. My opponent thinks it's a hoax created by the Chinese. And what that means is he would not be able to take advantage of the economic opportunities that climate change presents. You see, some country's going to be the clean energy superpower of the 21st Century. I think it's going to be either China, Germany, or us. I want it to be us, and it can be us if we make up our minds for that to happen. Let's deploy a half a billion more solar panels. Let's produce enough clean energy so that every home in America can be powered by it. There's so much we can do together. And that means we've got to work with other countries and we've got to demonstrate that we support our allies, whether they're in Europe, the Middle East with Israel, or Asia, that we stand with those who stand with us.\n\nAnd then, finally, one of the next priorities that I have if I am so fortunate enough as to be your president is to bring our country together. I've got to tell you, look, disagreements, political disagreements, that's fine. That's who we are. I don't know any two people in America who agree on everything politically with each other. And I've known, been fortunate enough to know, a number of our more recent presidents. I didn't always agree with them either, including my husband. But I'll tell you this: Republicans and Democrats alike, I never doubt they were trying to put the country's interests first. They were trying to bring people together, not pit us against each other. And one of the things I will do from the very beginning, the very first day of my administration...\n\n...is to make them day one - you're right - is to make sure everybody in the country knows I'm the president of every American, every single per-son.\n\nNow - so in order for me to do any of this, anything that's in this book and making sure that it's paid for by the wealthy and corporations who have to pay their fair share finally, all of that, depends upon whether we win in November. The stakes could not be higher. So here is what I am asking all of you. How many of you know you are registered to vote? So we need to get everybody to be registered at your current address by October 11th. If you've moved, you may need to reregister. Here's how you can find out if you are registered. You can go to iwillvote.com, iwillvote.com. You put in your name. You put in your address and make sure you're registered. If you need to get registered, we have volunteers here. Right? And they will - they have - they have clipboards. We're kind of low-tech about it. They have clipboards. They can help you get registered right here and now or, as I say, you can go to iwillvote.com and check your registration. And, remember, you can vote by mail starting October 24th here in Broward. And the other thing you can do is convince everybody you know to make sure they're registered and to help them know how to vote by mail so they could get their vote in without making any fuss or inconvenience.\n\nSo make no mistake. This election is going to be close. They always are. So every call you make, every door you knock on, every person you register could make the difference. So I'm asking you to go ahead and text JOIN, text JOIN, J?O?I?N, to 47246 to get involved or go to hillaryclinton.com. And you can volunteer and become involved. If we win Broward County by as big a margin as we should win it, we win Florida.\n\nAnd, like I say, I'm not just excited about winning an election. I'm excited about doing the work. I'm excited about listening to Americans. I'll continue to travel our country. I'll be here in Florida so much you'll get sick of me because I want to be a good partner for Florida. I mean, Florida is already suffering from climate change, and you have a governor who ordered the state government never to say the word or write the phrase. That's kind of hard to believe. So there's a lot we're going to do together: jobs, rising incomes, opportunities. And that's what gets me excited.\n\nSo here's what I hope you will do. When you leave here, if somebody says, 'Where were you this afternoon?' you say, 'Oh, I went to a rally for Hillary Clinton.' If they say, 'Oh, that's great,'","93":"Good morning. Thank you, Christine, for that kind introduction.\nI also want to thank the Marcellus Shale Coalition, the Ohio Oil and Gas Association, and the West Virginia Oil and Natural Gas Association for inviting me to join you here today. Your organizations represent tens of thousands of jobs for hardworking Americans.\n\nLet me also recognize my friend, Harold Hamm.\n\nIt is great to be here in Pittsburgh, the Steel City. Under a Trump Administration, we are going to bring back our steel jobs and we are going to rebuild this nation.\n\nBefore going any further today, I want to address the turmoil unfolding right now in our country.\n\nOur country desperately needs unity, and it needs the spirit of togetherness that has not only got us through our toughest times - but which has lifted us up, in the past, to our greatest achievements as a nation. Every day, I see people of different backgrounds working together for a common good, and we need to bring that spirit to every part of our country - and become One American Nation, united by our shared values and principles as American Citizens.\n\nWe all have to walk a mile in someone else's shoes, see things through their eyes, and then get to work fixing our wounded country.\n\nMany Americans are watching the unrest in Charlotte unfolding on their TV screens. Others are witnessing the chaos and the violence firsthand.\n\nOur country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be the leader. How can we lead when we can't even control our own cities.\n\nWe honor and recognize the right of all Americans to peacefully assemble, protest and demonstrate. But there is no right to engage in violent disruption, or to threaten the public safety and peace.\n\nEvery single American in this country is entitled to live in a safe community. The violence against our citizens, and our law enforcement, must be brought to an end.\n\nThe people who will suffer the most as a result of these riots, are law-abiding African-American residents who live in these communities. It is their jobs, housing markets, schools and economic conditions that will suffer - and the first duty of government is to protect their well-being and safety.\n\nThere is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct. Crime and violence is an attack on the poor, and will never be accepted in a Trump Administration.\n\nOur job is not to make life more comfortable for the violent disruptor, but to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent trying to raise their kids in peace.\n\nFor every one violent protestor, there are thousands of moms and dads and kids in that same community who just want to be able to sleep safely at night.\n\nMore law enforcement, more community engagement, more effective policing is what our country needs.\n\nLast year, we saw a 17% rise in violent crime in our fifty largest cities. Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.\n\nMore than 3,000 have been shot in Chicago so far this year alone.\n\nNationwide, approximately 60% of murder victims under the age of 22 are African-American.\n\nThis is a national crisis, and it is the job of the next President to work with our governors and mayors to address this crisis and save African-American lives.\n\nLook at the example of Mayor Rudy Giuliani in New York. The policies he put into place ultimately brought down crime by 76 percent and murder by 84 percent. Think of how many families these policies saved from the worst heartache imaginable.\n\nWe need a national anti-crime agenda to make our cities safe again.\n\nI will appoint the best prosecutors, investigators and federal law enforcement officers in the country to dismantle the international cartels, gangs and criminal syndicates - and I will stop the drugs from flowing into our country.\n\nMy Administration will work with local communities and local officials to make the reduction of crime a top priority.\n\nSafety is the foundation of the ladder to American success: a great education, and a good-paying job. To have the best schools, and the best jobs, you must have safe communities.\n\nThat means we must recognize the contributions of our police, who come from all backgrounds and all walks of life, and who often thanklessly risk their own lives to protect the innocent.\n\nWe all remember, earlier this year, when officers in Dallas - hunted down for execution - continued protecting the public until their last moments on earth.\n\nEvery day, police officers risk their lives for complete strangers and, every year, many of them will go out on calls and never return.\n\nPolice are entrusted with immense responsibility, and we must do everything we can to ensure they are properly trained, that they respect all members of the public, and that any wrongdoing is always vigorously addressed.\n\nBut our men and women in blue also need our support, our thanks, and our gratitude. They are the line separating civilization from total chaos.\n\nThey are also the front lines of defense in the War on Terror, as we saw recently with their quick action following the terrorist attacks in New Jersey, and New York, and the off-duty police officer's heroic actions in Minnesota.\n\nIn addition to providing safety, we must provide economic opportunity. That begins with school choice, and leads to a secure job with a rising income.\n\nThis brings us to the subject of energy.\n\nProducing more American energy is a central part of my plan to Making America Wealthy Again - especially for the poorest Americans.\n\nAmerica is sitting on a treasure trove of untapped energy - some $50 trillion dollars in shale energy, oil reserves and natural gas on federal lands, in addition to hundreds of years of coal energy reserves.\n\nIt's all upside: more jobs, more revenues, more wealth, higher wages, and lower energy prices.\n\nI am going to lift the restrictions on American energy, and allow this wealth to pour into our communities - including right here in Pennsylvania.\n\nAccording to the Institute for Energy Research, lifting the restrictions on American energy, including shale production, will accomplish the following:\n\nincrease GDP by more than $100 billion annually\n\nadd over 500,000 new jobs annually\n\nincrease annual wages by more than $30 billion over the next 7 years\n\nincrease federal, state, and local tax revenues by almost $6 trillion over 4 decades\n\nincrease total economic activity by more than $20 trillion over the next 40 years.\n\nIn addition, we will streamline the permitting process for all energy infrastructure projects, including the billions of dollars in projects held up by President Obama - creating countless more jobs in the process.\n\nOverall, my entire economic plan - tax reform, regulatory reform, energy reform, and trade reform - will create at least 25 million new jobs over the next 10 years, assuming an average growth rate of 3.5 percent, and I believe we will reach 4% growth.\n\nMy tax plan includes a fifteen percent business tax rate, for small and large businesses, down from 35 percent today - turning America into a jobs magnet. Hillary Clinton would raise taxes on some small businesses to as high as 45 percent.\n\nIncome taxes will be simplified from 7 brackets to 3, and middle class Americans will get a major tax cut - including childcare deductions and tax-free childcare savings accounts.\n\nMy plan includes the elimination of all unnecessary regulations, and a temporary moratorium on new regulations not compelled by Congress or public safety. Overregulation is costing our economy $2 trillion a year.\n\nOn energy, my economic plan unlocks our shale oil and gas, and the energy technologies of both today and tomorrow.\n\nFinally, my plan includes a renegotiation of America's trade deals, and the enforcement of trade rules, to increase jobs and wealth inside the United States. Strong border controls will also protect our workers and save our budget trillions in the long-term.\n\nIt is perhaps the most pro-growth economic plan in American history.\n\nCompare that to my opponent. She plans a $1.3 trillion tax hike, massive new regulations, the offshoring of American jobs, and the aggressive restriction of American energy production. Her plan will help only her wealthy donors, and global special interests, who benefit from the rigged system.\n\nHillary Clinton wants to put the coal miners out of work, ban hydraulic fracturing in most places, and extensively restrict and ban energy production on public lands and in most offshore areas.\n\nThis will produce devastation for states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia, where shale energy and coal production are critical parts of the economy.\n\nHer plan hurts states like Colorado, Florida, Virginia, North Carolina, and any anywhere with access to either onshore or offshore energy resources.\n\nShe also supports blocking the energy infrastructure that is needed to move our energy resources to the marketplace.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, \"Overall, more than a dozen  projects, worth about $33 billion, have been either rejected by regulators or withdrawn by developers since 2012, with billions more tied up in projects still in regulatory limbo.\"\n\nExamples of energy transportation projects blocked or abandoned include an $850 million coal export facility in Washington, a $3 billion natural gas pipeline in the Northeast, and a $6.8 billion Liquid Natural Gas export facility, among others.\n\nBillions of dollars in private infrastructure investment have been lost to the Obama-Clinton restriction agenda.\n\nThe platform produced by Hillary Clinton's party this year also calls for a \"price on carbon.\" That's just political-speak for a massive new tax on coal and shale production - a tax on American consumers.\n\nAnd remember, every energy dollar that isn't harvested here in America is harvested instead in a foreign country - often foreign countries not very friendly to us.\n\nThat not only means we are sending our jobs to those countries, but it means energy is being produced in foreign countries that lack our high environmental and conservation standards.\n\nThat is just one more reason why we should pursue the safe and responsible production of America's vast energy reserves.\n\nWe need an America-First energy plan.\n\nThis means opening federal lands for oil and gas production; opening offshore areas; and revoking policies that are imposing unnecessary restrictions on innovative new exploration technologies.\n\nThe development of the Marcellus and Utica Shales will fundamentally change the economic landscape of this region and our country, bringing extraordinary new prosperity to millions - more jobs, higher wages, a larger tax base, and dollars flowing into our country for a change, instead of out of our country.\n\nHillary Clinton's war on energy will cost our economy $5 trillion dollars.\n\nShe has not only declared war on the miners but on oil and natural gas production - which supports 10 million jobs in the United States.\n\nAccess to low-cost liquid natural gas also supports the American chemical industry, which supports 40,000 jobs in Pennsylvania.\n\nWe have just begun, as a nation, to recognize our economic advantage that is made possible by shale energy. The Shale Energy Revolution will unleash massive wealth for American workers and families.\n\nAt the same time, this energy revolution will produce new demand for American steel.\n\nBut federal restrictions remain a major impediment to both shale production specifically, and energy production in general.\n\nCurrently, less than 10 percent of the federally managed surface and mineral estates are leased for oil and gas development.\n\nAlmost 90% of our nation's offshore acreage is off-limits to energy production.\n\nOur energy policy will make full use of our domestic energy sources, including traditional and renewable energy sources.\n\nThat means we will end the war on coal.\n\nI will rescind the coal mining lease moratorium, the excessive Interior Department stream rule, and conduct a top-down review of all anti-coal regulations issued by the Obama Administration.\n\nWe will eliminate the highly-invasive \"Waters of the US\" rule, and scrap the $5 trillion dollar Obama-Clinton Climate Action Plan and the Clean Power Plan - these unilateral plans will increase monthly electric bills by double-digits without any measurable improvement in climate.\n\nI will refocus the EPA on its core mission of ensuring clean air, and clean, safe drinking water for all Americans.\n\nI believe firmly in conserving our wonderful natural resources and beautiful natural habitats. My environmental agenda will be guided by true specialists in conservation, not those with radical political agendas.\n\nIt will be a future of conservation, of prosperity, and of great success.\n\nIt will be a future of new technology, new innovation, and new solutions.\n\nIt will be a future we can achieve together, beginning with a victory on November 8th.\n\nWe Will make America Wealthy Again.\n\nWe Will make America Safe Again.\n\nAnd We Will Make America Great Again.\u0000","94":"Thank you. I want to applaud my daughter, Ivanka, for her work and leadership on the issues facing working moms in our country. She has been deeply invested in this since long before the campaign began, and I am so grateful for her work and efforts on this proposal which I will be outlining today.\nI want to also take a moment to recognize Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Chairwoman of the House Republican Conference and a mother of three small children, who has been such a leader on these issues.\n\nWe are also joined tonight by some amazing members of Congress in our  Congresswoman Blackburn, Lummis, Black, and Ellmers.\n\nOur campaign is about ideas. We're about solutions. I've travelled all over the country in recent weeks offering detailed plans to make life better for you and your family.\n\nI've outlined detailed proposals for providing school choice, reforming our tax and regulatory code, lifting restrictions on American energy, rebuilding our military, changing our foreign policy, fixing our immigration policy, and keeping our country safe.\n\nRight now, our politicians have locked our country into endless fights about small and petty things. I'm asking the nation to lift our sights, and to imagine what we can accomplish if we work together, trust each other, and put the needs of our own citizens first.\n\nWe must break our ties with the failed and bitter politics of the past and pursue a future where every American is honored and respected.\n\nWe have to reject the arrogance of Washington D.C. that looks down on everyday hardworking people. Too often those who have power have disdain for the views, beliefs and attitudes of those who don't have political power.\n\nThose in leadership must put themselves in the shoes of the laid-off factory worker, the family worried about security, or the mom struggling to afford childcare.\n\nThat means we need working mothers to be fairly compensated for their work, and to have access to affordable, quality child care for their kids.\n\nWe want higher pay, better wages, and a growing economy for everyone.\n\nThese solutions must update laws passed more than half a century ago when most women were still not in the labor force. Today, nearly 2 in 3 mothers with young children have jobs.\n\nFor many families in our country, childcare is now the single largest expense - even more than housing.\n\nYet, very little meaningful policy work has been done in this area - and my opponent has no childcare plan.\n\nMany Americans are just one crisis away from disaster - a sick kid, a lost job, a damaged home. There is no financial security.\n\nBut that will all change under our pro-family, pro-child, pro-worker plans I am outlining tonight. Before going any further, I want everyone watching on TV right now to go to DonaldJTrump.com to read the full plan.\n\nThe first part of my childcare plan allows every parent or family in America - including adoptive parents and foster parent guardians - to deduct their childcare expenses from their income taxes.\n\nThey will be able to fully deduct the average cost of child care for their state, from birth through the age of 13.\n\nBecause of the way the benefit is capped and structured, our plan will bring relief to working and middle class families.\n\nThe deduction also applies to elder care, capped at a $5,000-dollar deduction per year.\n\nImportantly, our policy also supports mothers who choose to stay at home, and honors and recognizes their incredible contributions\n\nto their families and to our society. Families with a stay-at-home parent will be able to fully deduct the average cost of child care from their taxes.\n\nFor low-income individuals who have no net income tax liability, we will offer an expanded Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) in the form of a childcare rebate. Working parents can get an expanded EITC benefit that equals up to half of their total payroll tax - a major relief for low-income parents. This translates to as much as an extra $1,200 dollars in EITC benefits for working families.\n\nNext, our plan allows every parent in America to open up a Dependent Care Savings Account. Families can contribute up to $2,000 dollars a year to these accounts completely tax-free. Crucially, unlike the flexible spending accounts that exist today, these accounts will be available to all Americans - you won't have to depend on your employer to provide them.\n\nImmediate family and employers can also contribute to a dependent account, each of which is designated for a specific child, including an unborn child.\n\nThe money that is put into these accounts can also be spent not only on child care, but also child enrichment activities. Additionally, the funds in these accounts do not expire at the end of the year - they don't revert to employers or to the Treasury. Instead, the funds rollover - so while only $2,000 dollars can be contributed each year, unspent sums can accumulate and create substantial savings.\n\nThese savings can then be used by parents to help give their kids school choice, and will thus contribute to the school choice reforms\n\nI outlined last week.\n\nThe funds will remain in the account until the age of 18. Whatever still remains at that time can be used to help offset the costs of higher education.\n\nFor low-income individuals, the federal government will provide matching funds - if parents contribute $1,000 dollars, the federal government will provide a $500 dollars match. To help low-income families reach these targets and save money, we will put a box on federal income tax forms allowing these parents to have their Earned Income Tax Credit funds directly deposited into their Dependent Care Savings Accounts.\n\nThese Dependent Care Savings Accounts can also be set-up to provide care for elderly dependents.\n\nOur plan also includes much needed regulatory reform to incentivize private sector solutions. The new funds offered by our plan will create a new market for innovative childcare solutions.\n\nBut to make sure these solutions are available, especially in low-income and rural communities, we must reduce regulations that favor large institutional care facilities. We will allow the states to make the decisions that are right for them.\n\nIn this era of the sharing economy, we want parents to be able to access lower-cost, competitive and innovative solutions at the click of a button - including services like nanny-sharing. Our plan would also cover care provided by relatives and grandparents.\n\nOur plan includes incentives for more employers to offer on-site childcare as well. This can often be a good solution for many working parents, and can save them up to 30 minutes of commute time. Currently, only 7% of employers provide these services. Our plan will expand tax deductions for employers, allow companies to pool resources to provide shared childcare services, and remove needless requirements that have prevented employers from using the credit.\n\nFinally, our plan offers a crucial safety net for working mothers whose employers do not provide paid maternity leave. This solution will receive strong bipartisan support, and will be completely self-financing. By recapturing fraud and improper payments in the unemployment insurance program, we can provide 6 weeks of paid-maternity leave to any mother with a newborn child whose employer does not provide the benefit. This maternity leave will be paid straight out of the unemployment insurance fund and, again, this safety net will be completely paid-for through savings within the program.\n\nThere are more reforms and solutions in our childcare plan, and you can review them all on the website.\n\nOn Thursday, I will outline my full economic plan, which is completely paid for through economic growth and proposed federal budget savings. Together, our tax, trade, regulatory, and energy policies will add trillions in new deficit-lowering growth.\n\nThese are the kinds of solutions I want to bring to the White House as your President. It's time to free ourselves from the baskets that politicians try to put us in, and instead to work together - not as Republicans or Democrats - but as Americans, to achieve real, positive results for the American people.\n\nWhile my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable, I call you, hard-working American Patriots who love your country, love\n\nyour families, and want a better future for all Americans.\n\nIt's time to end the rule of special interests, and to begin the rule of the American people.\n\nIt's time to stop fighting over the smallest words, and to start dreaming about the great adventures that lie ahead.\n\nIt is time to Believe In America.\n\nTogether, We Will Make Our Country Strong Again.\n\nWe Will Make Our Country Prosperous Again.\n\nAnd Will Make Our Country Great Again For Everyone.\u0000","95":"Thank you.\nIn 18 days, we are going to win the state of Pennsylvania and we are going to win the White House.\n\nBut you have to vote on November 8th.\n\nOur opponents have spent more money than ever before in the history of campaigns - raised from special interests - and yet we are leading in the polls from Rasmussen, LA Times, and Investor's Business Daily.\n\nTogether, we are going to deliver real change that puts America First.\n\nWe are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals, end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, reduce surging crime, cut taxes and regulations, end Common Core, and repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.\n\nYour jobs will come back under a Trump Administration. Your incomes will go up under a Trump Administration. Your taxes will go way down under a Trump Administration. Your companies won't be leaving Pennsylvania under a Trump Administration.\n\nWe are also going to rebuild our badly depleted military.\n\nOur Navy is the smallest it's been since World War I. My plan will build the 350 ship Navy we need. This will be the largest effort at rebuilding our military since Ronald Reagan, and it will require a truly national effort. The Philadelphia Navy Yard is a perfect example. I will instruct my Secretary of the Navy to study locations like Philadelphia with a long history of service to our military and proximity to vibrant private industry and find ways to involve them in this national effort.\n\nAs our fleet is rebuilt, we'll need to invest in recruiting the skilled American craftsmen we need, like welders and pipe fitters and so much more.\n\nWe will establish 'centers of excellence' in places like Philadelphia and Portsmouth New Hampshire and Hampton Roads in Virginia to produce the master craftsmen we need to rebuild our Fleet.\n\nWe will rebuild our navy and we will do it with American steel made right here in Pennsylvania.\n\nAs part of our plan for bold change to make your life better, we will also rebuild our massively depleted infrastructure.\n\nObama-Clinton doubled the national debt in 8 years - but instead of rebuilding America, the money was all lost and America's infrastructure is like that of a third-world country.\n\nWe're also spending $6 trillion dollars in the Middle East, with nothing to show for it.\n\nImagine if we had spent this money rebuilding the inner cities of Philadelphia.\n\nInstead, we spent trillions on foreign countries and left our own to crumble. We defend other countries' borders, invest in their resources, but abandon our own. The plan I am proposing targets substantial new investment here at home to fix America's transportation, drinking water, and other vital infrastructure. This can be achieved through a focus on public-private partnerships, proven financing programs, and tax credits that incentivize companies to make major job-and-wealth producing investments in the local economy.\n\nThis means help for projects like the Pennsylvania Turnpike as well as the Pennsylvania portion of the Appalachian Highway System. My plan will also help Pennsylvania upgrade or replace bridges in the Commonwealth that have been deemed \"structurally deficient.\"\n\nWe are also going to unleash the power of American energy right here in Pennsylvania - shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal.\n\nWe are putting Pennsylvania back to work, and we are putting the special interests out of work.\n\nWe are going to renegotiate NAFTA, stop the TPP, and stand up to foreign product dumping and currency manipulation.\n\nYour city has lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton signed NAFTA - a deal supported by Hillary Clinton.\n\n70,000 factories have shut down or left the United States since China entered the World Trade Organization.\n\nJust a few miles from here, there's a very famous bridge that says: \"Trenton Makes, The World Takes.\"\n\nUnder a Trump Administration, I can promise you: we are going to start making things in America again - and we are going to start making things in Pennsylvania again.\n\nYour products will be sent around the world, not your jobs.\n\nHillary is controlled by special interests who want to ship your jobs to other countries.\n\nShe's the most corrupt person ever to run for President.\n\nShe bleached and deleted 33,000 emails - after a Congressional subpoena - lied under oath to Congress, lied to the FBI, obstructed justice, made 13 phones disappear - some with a hammer - and now we learn 2 boxes of evidence have mysteriously gone missing.\n\nNow, from WikiLeaks, we've just learned she tried to get $12 million dollars from the King of Morocco for an appearance - more pay-for-play.\n\nThat is why I am proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again.\n\nIt's time to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C.\n\nOne new proposal I am outlining today will help us put the corrupt regulation industry out of business.\n\nI will work with Congress to require that for every 1 new regulation, 2 old regulations must be eliminated.\n\nWe're losing $2 trillion dollars in economic activity a year to regulations - the only people getting rich are the lobbyists, lawyers and special interests.\n\nI am also going to push for a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress.\n\nNot only will we end government corruption, but we will end economic stagnation.\n\nMy plan lowers our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent.\n\nWe are also going to rebuild our inner cities.\n\nAfrican-Americans and Hispanics living in the inner cities are suffering. The violence is unbearable. You walk to the store with your child and you get shot. There is no education, there are no jobs, there is no safety.\n\nNearly 3,500 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.\n\nHomicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore. And it's getting worse.\n\nTo the African-American and Hispanic voters suffering, I say: what do you have to lose?\n\nVote for Donald Trump. I will fix it.\n\nWe will take care of our inner cities, and we will bring safety, prosperity and security to the people of Philadelphia.\n\nWe will be a rich nation once again.\n\nBut to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country.\n\nNational security begins at the border.\n\nSpeaking in secret to a foreign bank Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally \"open trade and open borders.\"\n\nHillary's plan includes an open border with the Middle East - meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within our shores.\n\nShe even wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees.\n\nSo let me state this as clearly as I can. If I'm elected President I am going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country.\n\nWe will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration. A Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders. And yes, we will build a wall.\n\nWe have the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers.\n\nIt was just reported that a man deported from our country 10 times in six years has been charged with raping a 12-year old girl. In August, Texas Police arrested a serial illegal immigrant rapist who had been deported five times, one victim included a 68 year-old woman with a cane who took his offer to drive her home. He left her on the side of a dirt road.\n\nA 64 year-old Air Force Veteran, Marilyn Pharis, was raped and beaten to death with a hammer by a repeat-offending criminal illegal immigrant who should have been deported - but never was.\n\nIf I'm elected, we will impose tough new mandatory minimum federal prison sentences for anyone who illegally re-enters the country after previously being deported. And we will swiftly remove and deport all criminal aliens from this country, and dismantle the gangs and cartels preying on our citizens.\n\nEither we win this election, or we lose the country.\n\nA victory in November will be a victory for you, the American people.\n\nHere are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:\n\nWe are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation; defend religious liberty; provide school choice to every low-income child in America, and we are going to end Common Core; support the men and women of law enforcement; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\n\nFor the next 18 days, you have to get every last person you know out to the voting booths.\n\nThis is our one magnificent chance to reclaim our country for We The People.\n\nI am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation.\n\nI'm going to fight for every child living in poverty.\n\nI'm going to fight for every mom who lost her child to illegal immigration, and drugs and gang violence.\n\nI'm going to fight for every community whose jobs and factories have been ripped out of states like Pennsylvania and shipped to other countries.\n\nI'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people - not the donors and special interests.\n\nAnd I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.\n\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\n\nYou're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this day.\n\nThis is a movement like you've never seen before.\n\nYou're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote you've ever cast for anyone at any time.\n\nIf we win, the change you've been waiting for will finally arrive.\n\nWe Will Make America Wealthy Again.\n\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\n\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\n\nAnd We Will Make America Great Again.\u0000","96":"Thank you. Thank you all. Hello, everyone. It's great to be here at UNC Greensboro. I want to thank Martha for that wonderful introduction. It means so much to have her here along with her wonderful daughter, Sara, and her mother, Barbara. And the story she told is really one that motivates me every day because it is kids like Sara that led me to politics in the first place to try to make our country and our world better for them. So to see Sara grown up and thriving is very special, and your whole family's support really means the world to me. Thank you, Martha, Sara, Barbara\nI have to say it's great to be back on the campaign trail. As you may know, I recently had a cough that turned out to be pneumonia. I tried to power through it, but even I had to admit that maybe a few days of rest would do me good. And I'm not great at taking it easy, even under ordinary circumstances. But with just two months to go until Election Day? Sitting at home was pretty much the last place I wanted to be.\n\nBut it turns out having a few days to myself was actually a gift. I talked with some old friends. I spent time with our very sweet dogs. I did some thinking. The campaign trail doesn't really encourage reflection, and it's important to sit with your thoughts every now and then. And that did help me reconnect with what this whole campaign is about.\n\nPeople like me - we're lucky. When I'm under the weather - now, I just want to have a conversation, and other people can wave their arms and their signs. But I want you to think with me for a minute about how I certainly feel lucky. When I'm under the weather, I can afford to take a few days off. Millions of Americans can't. They either go to work sick, or they lose a paycheck, don't they?\n\nLots of Americans still don't even have insurance, or they do but it's too expensive for them to actually use. So they toss back some Tylenols, they chug orange juice, and they hope that the cough or the virus goes away on its own.\n\nLots of working parents can't afford childcare, which in many states costs as much as college tuition. So for millions of moms and dads, if they get sick, there's no backup. They're on their own, aren't they?\n\nThat's the story for too many people still in America. When illness strikes, or an accident happens, you feel you're on your own. If you lose your job or can't afford college, you're on your own. If your aging parent starts needing more help, and you don't know what to do, you're on your own.\n\nLife events like these are catastrophic for some families, but mere bumps in the road for others. I have met so many people living on a razor's edge, one illness away from losing their job, one paycheck away from losing their home. And that goes against everything we stand for as Americans. Because some things should not come down to luck. Some things should be within reach for everyone, no matter what. Like financial security. Like affordable health care. Like the peace of mind that comes with knowing that if something goes wrong, your family will be okay. And above all, the knowledge that no matter what, your president is fighting for you and will always have your back.\n\nThat right there, that's why I got into this race. I am running for everyone working hard to support their families, everyone who's been knocked down but gets back up. The factory workers on their feet all day, and the nurses looking after patients all night. I'm running for young people like so many of you here, who dream of changing our world for the better, and for all the parents and grandparents supporting those dreams by dedicating every dollar they can spare to your education.\n\nI'm running for the LGBT teenager here in North Carolina who sees your governor sign a bill legalizing discrimination and suddenly feels like a second-class citizen. And if anyone wonders what the costs of discrimination are, just ask the people and businesses of North Carolina. Look at what's happening with the NCAA and the ACC. This is where bigotry leads, and we can't afford it - not here, not anywhere else in America.\n\nI'm running for women like Janelle Turner. Back in May of last year, Janelle was diagnosed with breast cancer. She went through nearly six months of very tough treatments. Last October, she brought her eight-year-old daughter to one of our rallies in Iowa and they made a huge sign that read, 'Thirteenth chemo yesterday. Three more. Hear me roar!' Wouldn't you want to meet the woman behind that sign? Well, I sure did. So we got talking, and we've stayed in touch. She keeps promising me she'll see me at the inauguration. And I tell her I'll keep working to get there, but she'd better be there too.\n\nI'm running for her and all the mothers and fathers trying to get and stay healthy so they can be there for their kids. But perhaps most of all, I'm running for those kids. Standing up for children has been the work of my life. As a lawyer with the Children's Defense Fund, as First Lady in Arkansas, in the White House, as a Senator, I have fought for kids housed in adult jails, kids who have been neglected and abused, kids who couldn't get health insurance because of pre-existing conditions, kids with disabilities so they could go to school. You heard today from someone I've known for a long time, now grown up and a lovely young woman, Anastasia Somoza. I learned from my family and my Methodist faith that we are each called to do all the good we can for all the people we can for however long we can. And to me, that means making sure all our children have the chance to live up to their God-given potentials.\n\nSo when I meet a little girl in Nevada terrified that her parents are going to be deported, it hits me right in the gut. When I meet a little boy in Flint, Michigan, who can't drink the water at home or in school because it's poisoned with lead, that gets me going. All I want to do is get to work making things better for them.\n\nThat's why I care so much about national security too. I want to give our kids a safer world. To me, that means a world with strong allies, more friends, fewer enemies, and fewer nuclear weapons. It also means leading the fight against climate change so we can leave our kids a health planet.\n\nMy opponent in this race disagrees with me on every one of these fronts. Just a few days ago he said that if another country's troops taunted ours - not fired at them, but taunted them, just taunts - he'd responded - he would respond by blowing them out of the water. He would start a war over that. That is just one more reason, my friends, why the stakes in this election are as high as any in our lifetimes.\n\nI've been involved in politics in one way or another for many years. It is not an easy business. It can get rough and I've built up some defenses. When it comes to public service, I'm better at the 'service' part than the 'public' part. But this is why I do it, and this is who I'm in it for: to make life better for children and families. And that's what this race has always been about for me.\n\nWell, now we're in the final stretch. There are just 54 days till Election Day. Just 54 days till the most consequential vote of our lifetimes. And just a little more than a month until early voting starts here in North Carolina. Let's make these days count, particularly here, because you know what your governor and legislature tried to do - make it harder for young people to vote, harder for people of color, harder for people with disabilities, harder for the elderly. There can't be any more motivation than that to make sure every young person, every person of color, every person with a disability, every older person turns out and votes.\n\nSo in these final days, let's try to tune out all the chatter and the nonstop analysis that doesn't often have much to do with what the next president has to do to create good jobs, to create opportunity, to make it possible for every young person to afford to go to college or get the skills that you need for the jobs of the future. Let's talk about what really matters.\n\nAnd here's my promise to you. I'm going to close my campaign the way I began my career and the way I will serve as your president should you give me that great honor - focused on opportunities for kids and fairness for families.\n\nNext week, I'll go to Philadelphia to talk about challenges facing our young people; in Florida, to focus on building an economy that welcomes everyone's contributions, in-cluding people with disabilities; then I'll be back here in North Carolina, to meet with more working families. From now until November 8th, everywhere I go, I'm going to talk about my ideas for our country. My campaign has rolled out detailed plans in 38 different policy areas - yes, somebody actually counted. Everything from reining in Wall Street to creating good-paying jobs to fighting Alzheimer's to supporting people with autism. You see, I have this old-fashioned notion that if you're running for president, you should say what you plan to do, how you're going to get it done, and how you're going to pay for it. You can read it all on my website, hillaryclinton.com. We even put it in a new book called, you guessed it, Stronger Together. Get a copy of it because it tells you everything Tim Kaine and I intend to do.\n\nNow, like a lot of women, I have a tendency to over-prepare. I sweat the details, whether we're talking about the exact level of lead in the water in Flint, or how many North Carolina kids are in early enrichment programs, or the precise interest rate on your student loans right down to the decimal. Because you know what? It's not a detail if it's your kid. It's not a detail if it's your family. It's a big deal. And it should be a big deal to your president.\n\nNow, I confess, I'll never be the showman my opponent is, and that's okay with me. Just look at - look at the show he put on with Dr. Oz today. But I am going to deliver for you and your family, just like I did for Sarah all those years ago with the Children's Health Insurance Program, that gave her the chance to be the extraordinary young woman she is. And I'll tell you something else. People accuse me of all kinds of things. You probably have seen that. But nobody ever accuses me of quitting. And I will never give up, I'll never walk away, no matter how tough the going gets. I'm actually asking Americans to hold me accountable for my ideas and hold my opponent accountable for his.\n\nWe don't need a president who says the minimum wage is too high. We need a president who knows that Americans deserve a raise to get to a living wage. We don't need a president who wants to take away people's health coverage. We need a president who wants everyone to have quality, affordable health care. And we don't need a president who apparently thinks only married people deserve paid leave and only mothers stay home with kids. We don't need someone who rushes out a half-baked plan just weeks before an election after decades of ignoring or putting down working moms. We need a president who has spent years fighting for these issues, who has a plan to support all families in all their various shapes. Ask yourself which candidate you can count on to be on your side, respect your family, stand up and fight for you and your kids.\n\nThat is who you should vote for on November 8th because as Michelle Obama said in her fabulous speech at the Democratic convention, when we go to the polls this November, the real choice isn't between Democrat or Republican. It's about who will have the power to shape our children for the next four years of their lives. It's also about the kind of country we want to be and what we want to leave behind for future generations. People have to decide, are we going to make our economy work for everyone or just those at the top? Are we going to bring people together or pit Americans against each other and rip our country apart? Are we going to work with our allies to keep us safe, or are we going to put a loose cannon in charge who would risk everything generations of Americans have worked so hard to build?\n\nNow, I have a lot of confidence in the American people and in our country. My opponent keeps running us down, saying we're weak, a disaster, an embarrassment. Every time he says things like that, I think about Janelle and her strength in the face of cancer, or Martha and Sarah in the face of their health challenges, and that little boy in Flint, who gets up every day and goes to school even though he can't drink the water. See, my opponent has America all wrong. There's nothing we can't do when we come together as one nation, set big goals, and pursue them.\n\nAnd the American dream - the American dream is big enough for everyone to share in its promise. So if you believe the minimum wage should be a living wage, that no one who works full-time should have to raise their child in poverty, join us. If you believe that every man, woman, and child in America has the right to affordable health care and women should be free to make our own health decisions, join us. If you believe - if you believe your working mother, wife, sister, or daughter deserves equal pay, then join us. Get involved these last 55 days. Go to hillaryclinton.com or text 'join,' j-o-i-n, to 47246. We need volunteers right here in North Carolina. We can't do this without you.\n\nAnd remember, the presidential race isn't the only one this fall. We've got a lot of im-portant statewide races. Let's come together and send Deborah Ross to represent the people in the Senate. Starting on October 20th, you can register and vote early at the same time at any one-stop early voting site in your county. So the heat is on. Spread the word. Tell your friends, your family, your neighbors. If you share our vision for America's future, come be part of helping us shape it. We do not have a minute to lose.\n\nWe have so many blessings. Now it's our job to deliver on those and to make sure every single person, and particularly every child, no matter who they are, what they look like, or who they love, is part of the American dream now and way into the future. Let that be our message. Let that be our mission. Please come out and help us fight, fight for you, fight for our children, fight for our families. Let's make America all that it should be. Thank you and God bless you!\u0000","97":"It's so great to be back in Ohio.\nCome November, we are going to win this state, we are going to win the White House - and we are going to bring back your jobs.\n\nWe are going to negotiate fair trade deals that put American workers first.\n\nWe are going to stop the product dumping, the unfair foreign subsidies, and the currency manipulation. We are going to stop the foreign cheating.\n\nThe era of economic surrender is over.\n\nA new era of American Greatness is beginning.\n\nNo state has been hurt worse by the Hillary Clinton trade policies than Ohio.\n\nHillary Clinton backed her husband's NAFTA, she backed China's entrance into the World Trade Organization, she backed the job-killing trade deal with South Korea, and backed the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n\nOne bad deal after another.\n\nHillary Clinton's donors own her, and she will do whatever they tell her to do.\n\nOhio has lost nearly 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, and nearly 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs since China entered the World Trade Organization.\n\nOur trade deficit in goods with the world is now nearly $800 billion dollars. This subtracts directly from our growth - our economy grew only 1.1 percent in the last quarter, a total disaster.\n\nThis is the legacy of Hillary Clinton.\n\nI am promising a new legacy for America.\n\nWe are going to create a New American Future.\n\nBut to do that, we have to stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n\nOur trade deficit with the proposed TPP member countries cost the state of Ohio more than 100,000 manufacturing jobs last year. Imagine how many more jobs would be lost if TPP was actually approved.\n\nHillary Clinton, who called the TPP the \"Gold Standard\", would 100% approve it if she ever got in.\n\nWe won't let that happen.\n\nWe will win this election, and we will keep America out of the TPP.\n\nWe will defend our freedom, our jobs, and our economic independence.\n\nIt's going to be America First.\n\nMy economic plan is going to grow this economy, raise your wages, and create millions of new jobs.\n\nHere are a few of the things we will do:\n\nA massive tax cut for working Americans.\n\nWe are going to eliminate regulations that kill American jobs, and that includes getting rid of the Obama Administration's new anti-energy rules that will raise Ohio energy bills by more than 40 percent.\n\nHillary Clinton says she wants to \"put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.\" Just like she wants to put the steel workers out of business.\n\nWe are going to put the miners and the steel workers back to work - and we are going to get your energy bills down.\n\nWe are going to repeal and replace Obamacare, saving another 2 million jobs over the next decade.\n\nWe are going to create jobs for all of our people, and we are going to fight to ensure that every young African-American and Latino child is put on the ladder of American success: a good education, and a great job.\n\nAnother major part of our agenda is immigration security. We need to protect American jobs. We need to protect American safety.\n\nLast night, I outlined a detailed plan to provide jobs, safety and security to the American people with bold new immigration reforms.\n\nI had a great meeting yesterday with the President of Mexico where we both expressed our shared desire to secure the border, put the cartels out of business, and to keep jobs in our hemisphere.\n\nLet's also talk about government corruption.\n\nNo issue better illustrates how corrupt my opponent is than her pay-for-play scandals as Secretary of State.\n\nHere is one example of Clinton Corruption.\n\nAs Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton signed off on a deal allowing Russians to take an increased stake in a company called Uranium One, giving up control of about 20 percent of America's uranium supply to the Russians. Clinton's approval of the deal netted the owners of the uranium company millions of dollars. In exchange for signing off on the deal, some of the former owners of Uranium One gave the Clinton Foundation millions of dollars in donations. In addition, Bill Clinton received $500,000 for a speech to a Kremlin-backed investment firm that was a beneficiary of the deal.\n\nHere is another example of pay-for-play.\n\nIn 2009, Ericsson telecommunications came under U.S. pressure for selling telecom equipment to several oppressive governments - including Sudan, Syria, and Iran. Some these regimes used those technologies to monitor and control their own people.\n\nIn June 2011, Hillary Clinton's state department began adding goods and service to a list that might be covered under expanded sanctions on Iran and other state sponsors of terrorism.\n\nDuring that time, Ericsson sponsored a speech by Bill Clinton, paying him $750,000 - his highest paying speech.\n\nIn April 2012, the Obama Administration issued an executive order imposing sanctions on telecom sales to Iran and Syria -but those sanctions did not cover Ericsson's work in Iran.\n\nA Trump Administration will end the government corruption.\n\nNo one will be above the law.\n\nWe will have one set of rules for everyone. In Hillary Clinton's world, we have one set of rules for her - and another set of rules for everyone else.\n\nI am fighting for everyone who doesn't have a voice. The forgotten men and women of America.\n\nI am your voice.\n\nHillary Clinton's campaign is funded by Wall Street and hedge fund managers.\n\nMy campaign is powered by my own money, but also by small dollar donations from working people across this country who want their country back.\n\nNothing terrifies the ruling class more than when everyday working people give 5, 10, or 15 dollars to our campaign to help us take government away from the special interests and give it back to the voters.\n\nCome November 8th, we are once again going to have a government that serves you, your family, and your country.\n\nWe are going to rebuild our depleted military, avoid needless foreign wars, build new friendships overseas, and remember those three famous words: Peace Through Strength.\n\nWe are going to work with our allies to crush, defeat, and utterly destroy ISIS.\n\nWe are going to have a new immigration screening test to keep people out of our country who don't support our tolerant values.\n\nMy tax reforms will add millions of new jobs and thousands of new small businesses.\n\nMy energy reforms will create millions of new jobs and lower the prince of your energy bill.\n\nMy trade reforms will raise wages, grow jobs and add trillions in new wealth into our country.\n\nMy immigration reforms will protect your jobs and stop businesses from exploiting visas programs that hurt poor workers.\n\nMy infrastructure plans will rebuild your roads, bridges and airports.\n\nMy regulatory reforms will make it easier for African-Americans small businesses to thrive, and for young children to live out their dreams.\n\nMy promise of school choice, charter schools and merit-pay for teachers will help low-income students in our inner cities. Hillary Clinton discriminates against poor African-American children by opposing school choice.\n\nMy government reforms will make your voice heard - not the voice of the special interests.\n\nEvery insider, getting rich off of our broken system, is throwing money at Hillary Clinton.\n\nIt's the powerful protecting the powerful.\n\nInsiders fighting for insiders.\n\nI am fighting for you.\n\nEvery day you turn on the nightly news, you hear about how some self-interested banker or some Washington insider says they oppose our campaign. Or some encrusted old politician says they oppose our campaign. Or some big time lobbyist says they oppose our campaign.\n\nI wear their opposition as a badge of honor. Because it means I am fighting for REAL change, not just partisan change. I am fighting - all of us across the country are fighting - for peaceful regime change in our own country. The media-donor-political complex that's bled this country dry has to be replaced with a new government of, by and for the people.\n\nI will fight to ensure that every American is treated equally, protected equally, and honored equally. We will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms, and seek a new future of security, prosperity and opportunity - a future built on our common culture and values as one American people.\n\nI am asking for your vote so I can be your champion in the White House.\n\nTo every parent who dreams for their children, and to every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I'm with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you.\n\nTogether, We Will Make America Strong Again.\n\nWe Will Make American Safe Again.\n\nAnd We Will Make America Great Again.\n\nThank you, and God Bless.\u0000","98":"Hello Detroit! Thank you! I'll tell you, I am so glad to be back in Michigan. And that introduction, I'm just still vibrating from it. I thank my longtime friend, Reverend Wendell Anthony, for giving us some of the best lines that we've had in the whole campaign. Thank you Wendell.\nYou know, there's something special about this place. And some of you may have recognized the song that was playing when I came in, an amazing anthem sung by the talented Andra Day called 'Rise Up.' And that is what Detroit is doing - you are rising up! And that is exactly what we're going to do in America. We are going to rise up and make sure the American dream is big enough for everyone.\n\nI'm looking forward to working with the great team you have here in Detroit and in Michigan. I want to thank your senators, Senator Debbie Stabenow and Senator Gary Peters. I want to thank your members of Congress, Congressman John Conyers, Sandy Levin, Congresswomen Brenda Lawrence and Debbie Dingell. I want to thank your great mayor, Mayor Mike Duggan, and thank you. Wayne County Executive Warren Evans. Sheriff Benny Napoleon. The president of the UAW, Dennis Williams. Longtime friends and former colleagues of mine, former Senator Carl Levin and his wife Barbara are here. And to all who are present today. And I was delighted that my friend and my supporter, Mark Cuban, could be here because - he's not only a real billionaire - he's actually shared his profits with his employees.\n\nNow, are you ready to vote on Tuesday? Are you ready to volunteer to get everybody out to vote? Are you ready to choose our next president and commander-in-chief? Did any of you see the three debates that we had? Well, I spent four and a half hours standing next to Donald Trump, proving once and for all I have the stamina to be the next president.\n\nNow, he kept saying a lot of unusual things, didn't he? And, you know, there's a certain preparation you do to be ready for those debates, and of course I did it because I think you should prepare to be president of the United States. And I did practice my composure. People said to me, well, how did you do that? The things he was saying. And then in that second debate when he was following you around and lurching over you. I said, well, I did practice. And I had my friends and my family just spend hours saying terrible things to me. So I was ready. But he would say, like, 'Well, what have you done for 30 years?' And you know, I don't want to brag. But I do think it matters what you've done, and especially what you've done that maybe improves somebody else's life, right?\n\nAnd one of the great joys of this campaign has been traveling around our country meeting people who have been affected by what we've been doing. For example, as First Lady, I helped create the Children's Health Insurance Program, which covers eight million kids. And these are families that they're not poor families, they're working people, but they don't make enough money and they don't work for somebody who provides insurance, and so very often their kids were being affected by not getting the health care they should have had. I met a woman whose baby daughter when she was born was diagnosed as totally deaf, and the doctor said, 'We're sorry, there's really nothing we can do for her.' But this mother, like many mothers I know, did not take that for an answer, right? She got on the internet. She began to research and she found that there were treatments that she could maybe provide to her little daughter, but they were expensive and she and her husband didn't have that kind of money and they didn't have insurance. She was at her doctor's office and just so distraught, and the doctor said, 'Well, there's this new thing called the Children's Health Insurance Program. Maybe you should look into it.' Turned out she was eligible. She signed up. She started giving her daughter the best health care that every child in this country should be able to have, by the way. And when I was in North Carolina, I heard about her and I got to meet her, but more than that, I met her daughter, who talked to me and who just graduated from college - because she got the health care and she got the treatment that she deserved to have.\n\nI'll tell you what, that is how I judge my last 30 years. Have I done something to help somebody else? I am well aware of the blessings that I have had, and I want to be sure that all of us figure out a way to pay it forward, make it possible for more families, more kids to have the chance to live up to their own God-given potential.\n\nAnd I was a Senator in New York on 9\/11, so I know what can happen - the evil and the hatred of terrorism. I saw it. And I spent my time helping to rebuild New York City and helping to get health care for the brave first responders who ran toward danger, not away from it - our police, our firefighters, our EMTs. And I'll tell you who else we got covered. We got construction workers who ran with their supplies and their tools, and I see one right out there who knows exactly what I'm talking about. All across the city, people were leaving their job sites and rushing toward danger. That was America at its best. And don't ever forget what we are capable of being, who we are. We are not afraid. We are brave, courageous people who will do our best if given the chance.\n\nAs your Secretary of State, I went to 112 countries, negotiated ceasefires, reduced the threat of nuclear weapons, stood up for human rights and women's rights and worker rights and LGBT rights. I'm telling you this because I want you to know that I will do everything I can. If I am honored to be your president, I will get up every day in that White House, and I will go to work for you and your families to make it possible for you to get the chances and the opportunities you deserve to have.\n\nI want you to have a candidate you can vote for and not just someone to vote against. That's why Tim Kaine and I have run a campaign based on ideas and issues, not insults because if you really take a look at what is at stake in this election, it is a choice between two very different visions for America. I've got to say when I hear my opponent talk about America, I don't recognize the country he's talking about. It is so dark, so divisive, so hateful. That is not the America that I believe in. I believe that we should have a confident, optimistic, inclusive vision of where we're going and how we're going to get there. I love our country, and I believe in the American people. And I think there's nothing we can't achieve if we work together and we set some goals and we go after them. You see, we believe in an America that is bighearted, not small-minded. We believe in an America that is already great but can be greater if we do our part. And we believe America is great because America is good. Never forget that. If we lift each other up and not tear each other down, we can go even further. And I believe with all my heart. That's why the slogan of my campaign sums it up, that we are stronger together.\n\nAnd so come next January 20th, America is going to have a new president. I know - I know that - I know that a lot of people say that they want change. Well, let me tell you this. Change is inevitable. There will be change. The question is, what kind of change are we going to have?\n\nAre we going to build a stronger, fairer, better country or are we going to fear the future and each other? I sure hope not. That is not the America that I believe we are.\n\nAnd so here is what I want to ask you to do. I want you to talk to your friends and your family and your neighbors. Michigan is one of these states that doesn't have early voting. I've been all over the country going to states that are already voting. In fact, I don't know. About 31 to 32-3 million people have already voted in those states. But Michigan votes on Tuesday.\n\nAnd I imagine - I imagine there are - some of you know people who say they're going to vote for Donald Trump. Right? I know. I know. I understand that. I mean, I would hope you would try to stage an intervention before it's too late. But maybe you could ask them with you to imagine, imagine January 20th, 2017. And imagine that my opponent is taking the oath of office in front of the Capitol. Imagine having a president who demeans women and mocks the disabled, who insults African Americans and Latinos and Muslims, who personally engages in busting unions and preventing people from having the right to bargain collectively. Now, the truth is we really don't have to imagine what that would be like because everything he has said and done, both in his career and in this campaign, tells you what could happen.\n\nNow, Michelle Obama, who says so many wise and wonderful things, she said the presidency doesn't change who you are; it reveals who you are. And I think we've seen who Donald Trump is.\n\nMaya Angelou, another great American, Maya Angelou said, when someone shows you who he is, believe him the first time. And if my opponent were to win, we would have a president who has only ever been in it for himself.\n\nJust last year, he said again it wouldn't have mattered if we had rescued the auto industry or let it go bankrupt. What is he talking about? I'm proud that President Obama saved the auto industry. And I'm even prouder that because of the hard work of people in Detroit and across Michigan and the Midwest, the U.S. auto industry just had its best year ever.\n\nIf Donald wins the election, we'd have a president who wants to ban every Muslim in the world from coming to visit the United States. We are a country founded on religious freedom. That runs contrary to our Constitution. We would have a president who has said repeatedly that he thinks the lives of black people are all about crime and poverty and despair. He has no idea about the strength of the black church and the vibrancy of black-owned businesses and the excellence of historically black colleges and universities. He seems to know nothing about the rise of a new generation of black activists and the success of black leaders in every field. I think he needs a visit from Reverend Wendell Anthony, don't you?\n\nYesterday in North Carolina I was honored to stand with a woman named Mae Brown Wiggins. Decades ago, she was a hard-working nurse in New York City. She was looking for an apartment that she could afford to rent. But Donald Trump and his father, Fred, turned her away. You see, whenever African Americans tried to rent Trump apartments, their application was marked with a 'C,' C for colored. And that didn't sit very well with Mae, so she went to the authorities, and eventually the Department of Justice sued the to us for housing discrimination. And although they settled, they wouldn't change. So the government had to take them back to court. That's a pattern. This is what happens time and time again with my opponent. If he were to win, he would be in charge of the Federal Housing Department. If he doesn't respect all Americans now, how can we trust him to serve all Americans in the future?\n\nHe has such a casual disregard of our Constitution. He doesn't seem to understand the rule of law, that we really are a nation of laws, not men. Here's the latest example. There was a terrible crime back in 1990 in New York City. It was called the Central Park Five. Maybe some of you have heard of it. There were five black and Latino kids, some as young as 14. They were wrongfully convinced, and they were in prison where they spent years. Donald Trump took out full-page ads calling for the death penalty for the kids. And even after they were exonerated by DNA evidence and someone else confessed to that terrible crime, Trump actually said they should still be in prison. It doesn't matter if you're innocent. If he decides that you should be in prison or you should be locked up. No wonder he admired Vladimir Putin, because that's exactly what Putin does to his people.\n\nSo we can't trust him with our Constitution. We can't trust him to obey the rule of law. He has shown us who he is. Now we have to decide who we are. So let me paint you a different picture. Here is what we're going to do together if we win this election on Tuesday night.\n\nWe have three big challenges. Number one, we got to get the economy working for everyone, not just those at the top. Number two, we've got to keep our country safe, and we have to work with our allies to lead the world with strength and intelligence toward peace and prosperity. Number three, we've got to bring our country together. We have got to overcome these divides. We have to heal our nation. And I hope that you will help me meet all three of those challenges.\n\nI have said repeatedly that we're going to take on discrimination and bigotry because any time we hold somebody back, it can lead to holding other people back. We can't accept as normal what we're seeing across our country because of his campaign. A church in Mississippi was burned this week. Someone painted 'Vote Trump' on the side and then set it on fire. We can't let - we can't let that happen. What happened in Flint, Michigan should not be normal or acceptable. Our kids should be guaranteed clean air and clean water. Those are basics. We've got to do everything we can to make sure that we take care of our children.\n\nAnd it's important for us to recognize that when I talk about getting the economy to work for everybody, that means I want the biggest jobs program since World War II - infrastructure, advanced manufacturing, clean, renewable energy technology. Some people say we can't do that. Well, I'm telling you, they're wrong. They're wrong. We have the best workers, the most productive workers. We're going to give them more to work on, more products to produce. And we're going to do more for small business because small business is the backbone of so many communities. And I want everybody to have the chance to succeed in America. That means we're going to dismantle the so-called school-to-prison pipeline and replace it with the cradle-to-college pipeline.\n\nAnd we're going to make sure that every child has a chance to go to a good school with good teachers, no matter what zip code that child lives in. And I want to start with our youngest kids, with pre-kindergarten programs. And then I want to be a good partner with our teachers. We've got to have high expectation and get results in helping our children. And I want to be sure that we put technical education back into high school because there are good jobs out there waiting for young people with the skills to do them.\n\nIt'll be important that we create an environment in which our police and our communities can work together and trust each other. I believe we are safer when everyone has respect for the law and everyone is respected by the law. And that's what we're going to work for.\n\nWe're also going to take common-sense steps to reduce gun violence and save lives. This has nothing to do with the scare tactics coming from my opponent. Have you seen he's starting to wear a camo hat now? Really. We are going to work with responsible gun owners who understand that we've got to keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them in the first place.\n\nAnd while we create more safe communities, we want to invest in those communities. I want to continue the good work that our past two Democratic Presidents have done, one named Clinton, one named Obama. And I want to be a really strong partner. I'll compete a little with them. I want to be a really strong partner with Detroit and other cities that are on the way back up to make sure you get the investment and the support, the housing, and the jobs that you need.\n\nBut we also have to make sure our economy is fairer. That's why I believe we should raise the national minimum wage, because people who work full time should not be left in poverty. And isn't it finally time to guarantee equal pay for women? This is not a women's issue. If you have a wife, a mother, a daughter, or a sister who works, it's your issue. It's a family issue. And every time I talk about wanting to have affordable childcare, paid family leave, equal pay for women, the other side accuses me of playing the women's card. I'll tell you what, if standing up for equal pay is playing the women's card, then deal me in.\n\nAnd one of the other big challenges we're going to take on - I am so excited about this. I am really proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran because it was a campaign about issues. And what we decided after it was over is how we could work together to make sure that everybody who wants to go to college can afford not just to start but actually to graduate. So we came up with a plan that if you go to a public college or university, you will go tuition-free if your family makes less than $125,000 a year. And it will be debt-free for everybody above that so you don't go into debt. And for people who already have student debt, we're going to help you pay it down and pay it off to get out from under it. And I want especially to support historically black colleges and universities that have done so much to bring forth a leadership cadre in our country.\n\nNow, this is just some of what we are offering in this campaign, because we really believe you need to look at what will happen after the election. I had a friend say to me the other day, 'People are just frustrated and angry.' I get that. I understand that. We had the worst economic collapse since the Great Depression in '08 and '09. Millions of people lost their jobs, millions lost their homes, family wealth was wiped out. That is a trauma and people are still suffering and still climbing back from that. I get it. But I learned a long time ago from my late mother, anger is not a plan. Right? Be angry, vent about it, and then roll up your sleeves and get to work. That's what I will do. That's why we've put this all down. It's on our website, hillaryclinton.com. It's in a book that Tim Kaine and I put out called 'Stronger Together.' Because not only do I want you to know what I will try to do as your president; I want you to hold me accountable. I want you, when I come back to Detroit, which I will do when I travel around Michigan, which I will do, I want you to say, 'Well, how's it going getting those new jobs started? How much progress are we making on making sure college is affordable?' I believe in making lists. Maybe it's a women's thing. My husband said - once said to me one time, 'You have lists of your lists.' Well, I do because I want to know what we're going to get done and how we can make progress together.\n\nAnd ultimately, this election really is about the kind of country we want for our kids, and in my case now, my grandkids. Are we really a nation that believes in freedom and justice for all?\"\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n \"Are we really a nation that recognizes our best years can still be ahead of us if we make up our minds to have that be our goal? I believe we can do this together. My opponent at his convention said, 'I alone can fix it.' Well, no, nobody alone does anything. When our founders met in Philadelphia, it wasn't one person creating our country. It was many people working together and fighting a revolution to get that democracy and then to fight for civil rights and voting rights and workers' rights and women's rights and LGBT rights. None of them - none of them were won by one person alone. The American labor movement didn't happen because somebody one day said, 'I alone can make it happen.' It took millions of people in every one of these movements marching and speaking out and sitting in. Barack Obama wasn't put into the White House by one person alone. It took everybody working and organizing, and yes, voting. That is how progress happens in America.\n\nSo really, it all comes down to you, my friends. You have to vote. Our progress is on the line. Everything that has happened up until this point is on the line. I'm ready to defend and build on the progress that we've made. I'm proud I was a member of President Obama's cabinet. I'm proud that - he and I are friends. But he knows and I know that American leadership, American presidents, it's like running a relay. You do your very best, and then you pass off the baton and you just hope that the person you pass it off to doesn't drop to the ground or doesn't turn around and run back the way we came from, which is what my opponent is promising to do.\n\nNow, I've told the President that when he hands off the baton that he's going to have to bend over. He's a lot taller than I am. But I'm excited about what we can do. I know this has been a tough campaign. I've got people coming up to me saying they've got migraines they never had before. They have stomachaches that they don't know what they're going to do with. I get it. It has been in many ways a really tough campaign, but I'll tell you what. Michigan, you can make the difference.\n\nAll I'm asking you is talk to your friends, talk to your family, talk to your coworkers, talk to everybody.

When your children or grandchildren ask what you did in 2016 when everything was on the line, I want you to be able to say, 'I voted for a better, stronger, fairer America.' An America where we build bridges, not walls. And where we prove, once and for all, that love trumps hate. Let's get to work. Thank you. Thank you, Detroit. Thank you, Michigan. God bless you.\u0000"}}
